<h1>THE ROMANTIC ADVENTURES OF A MILKMAID.</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was half-past four o&rsquo;clock
(by the testimony of the land-surveyor, my authority for the
particulars of this story, a gentleman with the faintest curve of
humour on his lips); it was half-past four o&rsquo;clock on a May
morning in the eighteen forties.&nbsp; A dense white fog hung
over the Valley of the Exe, ending against the hills on either
side.</p>
<p>But though nothing in the vale could be seen from higher
ground, notes of differing kinds gave pretty clear indications
that bustling life was going on there.&nbsp; This audible
presence and visual absence of an active scene had a peculiar
effect above the fog level.&nbsp; Nature had laid a white hand
over the creatures ensconced within the vale, as a hand might be
laid over a nest of chirping birds.</p>
<p>The noises that ascended through the pallid coverlid were
perturbed lowings, mingled with human voices in sharps and flats,
and the bark of a dog.&nbsp; These, followed by the slamming of a
gate, explained as well as eyesight could have done, to any
inhabitant of the district, that Dairyman Tucker&rsquo;s
under-milker was driving the cows from the meads into the
stalls.&nbsp; When a rougher accent joined in the vociferations
of man and beast, it would have been realized that the
dairy-farmer himself had come out to meet the cows, pail in hand,
and white pinafore on; and when, moreover, some women&rsquo;s
voices joined in the chorus, that the cows were stalled and
proceedings about to commence.</p>
<p>A hush followed, the atmosphere being so stagnant that the
milk could be heard buzzing into the pails, together with
occasional words of the milkmaids and men.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ye bide about long upon the road,
Margery.&nbsp; You can be back again by skimming-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rough voice of Dairyman Tucker was the vehicle of this
remark.&nbsp; The barton-gate slammed again, and in two or three
minutes a something became visible, rising out of the fog in that
quarter.</p>
<p>The shape revealed itself as that of a woman having a young
and agile gait.&nbsp; The colours and other details of her dress
were then disclosed&mdash;a bright pink cotton frock (because
winter was over); a small woollen shawl of shepherd&rsquo;s plaid
(because summer was not come); a white handkerchief tied over her
head-gear, because it was so foggy, so damp, and so early; and a
straw bonnet and ribbons peeping from under the handkerchief,
because it was likely to be a sunny May day.</p>
<p>Her face was of the hereditary type among families down in
these parts: sweet in expression, perfect in hue, and somewhat
irregular in feature.&nbsp; Her eyes were of a liquid
brown.&nbsp; On her arm she carried a withy basket, in which lay
several butter-rolls in a nest of wet cabbage-leaves.&nbsp; She
was the &lsquo;Margery&rsquo; who had been told not to
&lsquo;bide about long upon the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went on her way across the fields, sometimes above the
fog, sometimes below it, not much perplexed by its presence
except when the track was so indefinite that it ceased to be a
guide to the next stile.&nbsp; The dampness was such that
innumerable earthworms lay in couples across the path till,
startled even by her light tread, they withdrew suddenly into
their holes.&nbsp; She kept clear of all trees.&nbsp; Why was
that?&nbsp; There was no danger of lightning on such a morning as
this.&nbsp; But though the roads were dry the fog had gathered in
the boughs, causing them to set up such a dripping as would go
clean through the protecting handkerchief like bullets, and spoil
the ribbons beneath.&nbsp; The beech and ash were particularly
shunned, for they dripped more maliciously than any.&nbsp; It was
an instance of woman&rsquo;s keen appreciativeness of
nature&rsquo;s moods and peculiarities: a man crossing those
fields might hardly have perceived that the trees dripped at
all.</p>
<p>In less than an hour she had traversed a distance of four
miles, and arrived at a latticed cottage in a secluded
spot.&nbsp; An elderly woman, scarce awake, answered her
knocking.&nbsp; Margery delivered up the butter, and said,
&lsquo;How is granny this morning?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stay to go
up to her, but tell her I have returned what we owed
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her grandmother was no worse than usual: and receiving back
the empty basket the girl proceeded to carry out some intention
which had not been included in her orders.&nbsp; Instead of
returning to the light labours of skimming-time, she hastened on,
her direction being towards a little neighbouring town.&nbsp;
Before, however, Margery had proceeded far, she met the postman,
laden to the neck with letter-bags, of which he had not yet
deposited one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are the shops open yet, Samuel?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; replied that stooping pedestrian, not
waiting to stand upright.&nbsp; &lsquo;They won&rsquo;t be open
yet this hour, except the saddler and ironmonger and little
tacker-haired machine-man for the farm folk.&nbsp; They downs
their shutters at half-past six, then the baker&rsquo;s at
half-past seven, then the draper&rsquo;s at eight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, the draper&rsquo;s at eight.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was
plain that Margery had wanted the draper&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The postman turned up a side-path, and the young girl, as
though deciding within herself that if she could not go shopping
at once she might as well get back for the skimming, retraced her
steps.</p>
<p>The public road home from this point was easy but
devious.&nbsp; By far the nearest way was by getting over a
fence, and crossing the private grounds of a picturesque old
country-house, whose chimneys were just visible through the
trees.&nbsp; As the house had been shut up for many months, the
girl decided to take the straight cut.&nbsp; She pushed her way
through the laurel bushes, sheltering her bonnet with the shawl
as an additional safeguard, scrambled over an inner boundary,
went along through more shrubberies, and stood ready to emerge
upon the open lawn.&nbsp; Before doing so she looked around in
the wary manner of a poacher.&nbsp; It was not the first time
that she had broken fence in her life; but somehow, and all of a
sudden, she had felt herself too near womanhood to indulge in
such practices with freedom.&nbsp; However, she moved forth, and
the house-front stared her in the face, at this higher level
unobscured by fog.</p>
<p>It was a building of the medium size, and unpretending, the
fa&ccedil;ade being of stone; and of the Italian elevation made
familiar by Inigo Jones and his school.&nbsp; There was a doorway
to the lawn, standing at the head of a flight of steps.&nbsp; The
shutters of the house were closed, and the blinds of the bedrooms
drawn down.&nbsp; Her perception of the fact that no crusty
caretaker could see her from the windows led her at once to
slacken her pace, and stroll through the flower-beds
coolly.&nbsp; A house unblinded is a possible spy, and must be
treated accordingly; a house with the shutters together is an
insensate heap of stone and mortar, to be faced with
indifference.</p>
<p>On the other side of the house the greensward rose to an
eminence, whereon stood one of those curious summer shelters
sometimes erected on exposed points of view, called an
all-the-year-round.&nbsp; In the present case it consisted of
four walls radiating from a centre like the arms of a turnstile,
with seats in each angle, so that whencesoever the wind came, it
was always possible to find a screened corner from which to
observe the landscape.</p>
<p>The milkmaid&rsquo;s trackless course led her up the hill and
past this erection.&nbsp; At ease as to being watched and scolded
as an intruder, her mind flew to other matters; till, at the
moment when she was not a yard from the shelter, she heard a foot
or feet scraping on the gravel behind it.&nbsp; Some one was in
the all-the-year-round, apparently occupying the seat on the
other side; as was proved when, on turning, she saw an elbow, a
man&rsquo;s elbow, projecting over the edge.</p>
<p>Now the young woman did not much like the idea of going down
the hill under the eyes of this person, which she would have to
do if she went on, for as an intruder she was liable to be called
back and questioned upon her business there.&nbsp; Accordingly
she crept softly up and sat in the seat behind, intending to
remain there until her companion should leave.</p>
<p>This he by no means seemed in a hurry to do.&nbsp; What could
possibly have brought him there, what could detain him there, at
six o&rsquo;clock on a morning of mist when there was nothing to
be seen or enjoyed of the vale beneath, puzzled her not a
little.&nbsp; But he remained quite still, and Margery grew
impatient.&nbsp; She discerned the track of his feet in the dewy
grass, forming a line from the house steps, which announced that
he was an inhabitant and not a chance passer-by.&nbsp; At last
she peeped round.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>A fine-framed dark-mustachioed gentleman, in dressing-gown and
slippers, was sitting there in the damp without a hat on.&nbsp;
With one hand he was tightly grasping his forehead, the other
hung over his knee.&nbsp; The attitude bespoke with sufficient
clearness a mental condition of anguish.&nbsp; He was quite a
different being from any of the men to whom her eyes were
accustomed.&nbsp; She had never seen mustachios before, for they
were not worn by civilians in Lower Wessex at this date.&nbsp;
His hands and his face were white&mdash;to her view deadly
white&mdash;and he heeded nothing outside his own
existence.&nbsp; There he remained as motionless as the bushes
around him; indeed, he scarcely seemed to breathe.</p>
<p>Having imprudently advanced thus far, Margery&rsquo;s wish was
to get back again in the same unseen manner; but in moving her
foot for the purpose it grated on the gravel.&nbsp; He started up
with an air of bewilderment, and slipped something into the
pocket of his dressing-gown.&nbsp; She was almost certain that it
was a pistol.&nbsp; The pair stood looking blankly at each
other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Gott, who are you?&rsquo; he asked sternly, and with
not altogether an English articulation.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you
do here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery had already begun to be frightened at her boldness in
invading the lawn and pleasure-seat.&nbsp; The house had a
master, and she had not known of it.&nbsp; &lsquo;My name is
Margaret Tucker, sir,&rsquo; she said meekly.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
father is Dairyman Tucker.&nbsp; We live at Silverthorn
Dairy-house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What were you doing here at this hour of the
morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She told him, even to the fact that she had climbed over the
fence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what made you peep round at me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw your elbow, sir; and I wondered what you were
doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what was I doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing.&nbsp; You had one hand on your forehead and
the other on your knee.&nbsp; I do hope you are not ill, sir, or
in deep trouble?&rsquo;&nbsp; Margery had sufficient tact to say
nothing about the pistol.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What difference would it make to you if I were ill or
in trouble?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She returned no answer, feeling that she might have taken a
liberty in expressing sympathy.&nbsp; But, looking furtively up
at him, she discerned to her surprise that he seemed affected by
her humane wish, simply as it had been expressed.&nbsp; She had
scarcely conceived that such a tall dark man could know what
gentle feelings were.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am much obliged to you for caring how I
am,&rsquo; said he with a faint smile and an affected lightness
of manner which, even to her, only rendered more apparent the
gloom beneath.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have not slept this past
night.&nbsp; I suffer from sleeplessness.&nbsp; Probably you do
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery laughed a little, and he glanced with interest at the
comely picture she presented; her fresh face, brown hair, candid
eyes, unpractised manner, country dress, pink hands, empty
wicker-basket, and the handkerchief over her bonnet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, after his scrutiny, &lsquo;I need
hardly have asked such a question of one who is Nature&rsquo;s
own image . . . Ah, but my good little friend,&rsquo; he added,
recurring to his bitter tone and sitting wearily down, &lsquo;you
don&rsquo;t know what great clouds can hang over some
people&rsquo;s lives, and what cowards some men are in face of
them.&nbsp; To escape themselves they travel, take picturesque
houses, and engage in country sports.&nbsp; But here it is so
dreary, and the fog was horrible this morning!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, this is only the pride of the morning!&rsquo; said
Margery.&nbsp; &lsquo;By-and-by it will be a beautiful
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was going on her way forthwith; but he detained
her&mdash;detained her with words, talking on every innocent
little subject he could think of.&nbsp; He had an object in
keeping her there more serious than his words would imply.&nbsp;
It was as if he feared to be left alone.</p>
<p>While they still stood, the misty figure of the postman, whom
Margery had left a quarter of an hour earlier to follow his
sinuous course, crossed the grounds below them on his way to the
house.&nbsp; Signifying to Margery by a wave of his hand that she
was to step back out of sight, in the hinder angle of the
shelter, the gentleman beckoned to the postman to bring the bag
to where he stood.&nbsp; The man did so, and again resumed his
journey.</p>
<p>The stranger unlocked the bag and threw it on the seat, having
taken one letter from within.&nbsp; This he read attentively, and
his countenance changed.</p>
<p>The change was almost phantasmagorial, as if the sun had burst
through the fog upon that face: it became clear, bright, almost
radiant.&nbsp; Yet it was but a change that may take place in the
commonest human being, provided his countenance be not too
wooden, or his artifice have not grown to second nature.&nbsp; He
turned to Margery, who was again edging off, and, seizing her
hand, appeared as though he were about to embrace her.&nbsp;
Checking his impulse, he said, &lsquo;My guardian child&mdash;my
good friend&mdash;you have saved me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What from?&rsquo; she ventured to ask.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you may never know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the weapon, and guessed that the letter he had
just received had effected this change in his mood, but made no
observation till he went on to say, &lsquo;What did you tell me
was your name, dear girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She repeated her name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Margaret Tucker.&rsquo;&nbsp; He stooped, and pressed
her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sit down for a moment&mdash;one
moment,&rsquo; he said, pointing to the end of the seat, and
taking the extremest further end for himself, not to discompose
her.&nbsp; She sat down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is to ask a question,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;and
there must be confidence between us.&nbsp; You have saved me from
an act of madness!&nbsp; What can I do for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father is very well off, and we don&rsquo;t want
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there must be some service I can render, some
kindness, some votive offering which I could make, and so imprint
on your memory as long as you live that I am not an ungrateful
man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you be grateful to me, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some things are best left
unspoken.&nbsp; Now think.&nbsp; What would you like to have best
in the world?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery made a pretence of reflecting&mdash;then fell to
reflecting seriously; but the negative was ultimately as
undisturbed as ever: she could not decide on anything she would
like best in the world; it was too difficult, too sudden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well&mdash;don&rsquo;t hurry yourself.&nbsp; Think
it over all day.&nbsp; I ride this afternoon.&nbsp; You
live&mdash;where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silverthorn Dairy-house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will ride that way homeward this evening.&nbsp; Do
you consider by eight o&rsquo;clock what little article, what
little treat, you would most like of any.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, sir,&rsquo; said Margery, now warming up to the
idea.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where shall I meet you?&nbsp; Or will you call
at the house, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;no.&nbsp; I should not wish the circumstances
known out of which our acquaintance rose.&nbsp; It would be more
proper&mdash;but no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery, too, seemed rather anxious that he should not
call.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could come out, sir,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My father is odd-tempered, and perhaps&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was agreed that she should look over a stile at the top of
her father&rsquo;s garden, and that he should ride along a
bridle-path outside, to receive her answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Margery,&rsquo; said the gentleman in conclusion,
&lsquo;now that you have discovered me under ghastly conditions,
are you going to reveal them, and make me an object for the
gossip of the curious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, sir!&rsquo; she replied earnestly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why should I do that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will never tell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, never will I tell what has happened here this
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither to your father, nor to your friends, nor to any
one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To no one at all,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is sufficient,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
mean what you say, my dear maiden.&nbsp; Now you want to leave
me.&nbsp; Good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She descended the hill, walking with some awkwardness; for she
felt the stranger&rsquo;s eyes were upon her till the fog had
enveloped her from his gaze.&nbsp; She took no notice now of the
dripping from the trees; she was lost in thought on other
things.&nbsp; Had she saved this handsome, melancholy, sleepless,
foreign gentleman who had had a trouble on his mind till the
letter came?&nbsp; What had he been going to do?&nbsp; Margery
could guess that he had meditated death at his own hand.&nbsp;
Strange as the incident had been in itself; to her it had seemed
stranger even than it was.&nbsp; Contrasting colours heighten
each other by being juxtaposed; it is the same with contrasting
lives.</p>
<p>Reaching the opposite side of the park there appeared before
her for the third time that little old man, the foot-post.&nbsp;
As the turnpike-road ran, the postman&rsquo;s beat was twelve
miles a day; six miles out from the town, and six miles back at
night.&nbsp; But what with zigzags, devious ways, offsets to
country seats, curves to farms, looped courses, and triangles to
outlying hamlets, the ground actually covered by him was nearer
one-and-twenty miles.&nbsp; Hence it was that Margery, who had
come straight, was still abreast of him, despite her long
pause.</p>
<p>The weighty sense that she was mixed up in a tragical secret
with an unknown and handsome stranger prevented her joining very
readily in chat with the postman for some time.&nbsp; But a keen
interest in her adventure caused her to respond at once when the
bowed man of mails said, &lsquo;You hit athwart the grounds of
Mount Lodge, Miss Margery, or you wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; met me
here.&nbsp; Well, somebody hey took the old place at
last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In acknowledging her route Margery brought herself to ask who
the new gentleman might be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Guide the girl&rsquo;s heart!&nbsp; What! don&rsquo;t
she know?&nbsp; And yet how should ye&mdash;he&rsquo;s only just
a-come.&mdash;Well, nominal, he&rsquo;s a fishing gentleman, come
for the summer only.&nbsp; But, more to the subject, he&rsquo;s a
foreign noble that&rsquo;s lived in England so long as to be
without any true country: some of his letters call him Baron,
some Squire, so that &rsquo;a must be born to something that
can&rsquo;t be earned by elbow-grease and Christian
conduct.&nbsp; He was out this morning a-watching the fog.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Postman,&rdquo; &rsquo;a said, &ldquo;good-morning: give
me the bag.&rdquo;&nbsp; O, yes, &rsquo;a&rsquo;s a civil genteel
nobleman enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Took the house for fishing, did he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what they say, and as it can be for
nothing else I suppose it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; But, in final, his
health&rsquo;s not good, &rsquo;a b&rsquo;lieve; he&rsquo;s been
living too rithe.&nbsp; The London smoke got into his wyndpipe,
till &rsquo;a couldn&rsquo;t eat.&nbsp; However, I
shouldn&rsquo;t mind having the run of his kitchen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is his name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;there you have me!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a name no
man&rsquo;s tongue can tell, or even woman&rsquo;s, except by
pen-and-ink and good scholarship.&nbsp; It begins with X, and
who, without the machinery of a clock in&rsquo;s inside, can
speak that?&nbsp; But here &rsquo;tis&mdash;from his
letters.&rsquo;&nbsp; The postman with his walking-stick wrote
upon the ground,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Baron
von Xanten</span>&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>The day, as she had prognosticated, turned out fine; for
weather-wisdom was imbibed with their milk-sops by the children
of the Exe Vale.&nbsp; The impending meeting excited Margery, and
she performed her duties in her father&rsquo;s house with
mechanical unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Milking, skimming, cheesemaking were done.&nbsp; Her father
was asleep in the settle, the milkmen and maids were gone home to
their cottages, and the clock showed a quarter to eight.&nbsp;
She dressed herself with care, went to the top of the garden, and
looked over the stile.&nbsp; The view was eastward, and a great
moon hung before her in a sky which had not a cloud.&nbsp;
Nothing was moving except on the minutest scale, and she remained
leaning over, the night-hawk sounding his croud from the bough of
an isolated tree on the open hill side.</p>
<p>Here Margery waited till the appointed time had passed by
three-quarters of an hour; but no Baron came.&nbsp; She had been
full of an idea, and her heart sank with disappointment.&nbsp;
Then at last the pacing of a horse became audible on the soft
path without, leading up from the water-meads, simultaneously
with which she beheld the form of the stranger, riding home, as
he had said.</p>
<p>The moonlight so flooded her face as to make her very
conspicuous in the garden-gap.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah my
maiden&mdash;what is your name&mdash;Margery!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;How came you here?&nbsp; But of course I
remember&mdash;we were to meet.&nbsp; And it was to be at
eight&mdash;<i>proh pudor</i>!&mdash;I have kept you
waiting!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve thought
of something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thought of something?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; You said this morning that I was to
think what I would like best in the world, and I have made up my
mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did say so&mdash;to be sure I did,&rsquo; he replied,
collecting his thoughts.&nbsp; &lsquo;I remember to have had good
reason for gratitude to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; He placed his hand to
his brow, and in a minute alighted, and came up to her with the
bridle in his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was to give you a treat or
present, and you could not think of one.&nbsp; Now you have done
so.&nbsp; Let me hear what it is, and I&rsquo;ll be as good as my
word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To go to the Yeomanry Ball that&rsquo;s to be given
this month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Yeomanry Ball&mdash;Yeomanry Ball?&rsquo; he
murmured, as if, of all requests in the world, this was what he
had least expected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is what you call the
Yeomanry Ball?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At Exonbury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you ever been to it before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or to any ball?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But did I not say a gift&mdash;a present?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or a treat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes, or a treat,&rsquo; he echoed, with the air of
one who finds himself in a slight fix.&nbsp; &lsquo;But with whom
would you propose to go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I have not thought of that
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have no friend who could take you, even if I got
you an invitation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery looked at the moon.&nbsp; &lsquo;No one who can
dance,&rsquo; she said; adding, with hesitation, &lsquo;I was
thinking that perhaps&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear Margery,&rsquo; he said, stopping her, as
if he half-divined what her simple dream of a cavalier had been;
&lsquo;it is very odd that you can think of nothing else than
going to a Yeomanry Ball.&nbsp; Think again.&nbsp; You are sure
there is nothing else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite sure, sir,&rsquo; she decisively answered.&nbsp;
At first nobody would have noticed in that pretty young face any
sign of decision; yet it was discoverable.&nbsp; The mouth,
though soft, was firm in line; the eyebrows were distinct, and
extended near to each other.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have thought of it
all day,&rsquo; she continued, sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still, sir, if
you are sorry you offered me anything, I can let you
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry?&mdash;Certainly not, Margery,&rsquo; be said,
rather nettled.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you that whatever
hopes I have raised in your breast I am honourable enough to
gratify.&nbsp; If it lies in my power,&rsquo; he added with
sudden firmness, &lsquo;you <i>shall</i> go to the Yeomanry
Ball.&nbsp; In what building is it to be held?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the Assembly Rooms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And would you be likely to be recognized there?&nbsp;
Do you know many people?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not many, sir.&nbsp; None, I may say.&nbsp; I know
nobody who goes to balls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well; you must go, since you wish it; and if there
is no other way of getting over the difficulty of having nobody
to take you, I&rsquo;ll take you myself.&nbsp; Would you like me
to do so?&nbsp; I can dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, yes, sir; I know that, and I thought you might offer
to do it.&nbsp; But would you bring me back again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll bring you back.&nbsp; But,
by-the-bye, can <i>you</i> dance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reels, and jigs, and country-dances like the
New-Rigged-Ship, and Follow-my-Lover, and Haste-to-the-Wedding,
and the College Hornpipe, and the Favourite Quickstep, and
Captain White&rsquo;s dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very good list&mdash;a very good! but unluckily I
fear they don&rsquo;t dance any of those now.&nbsp; But if you
have the instinct we may soon cure your ignorance.&nbsp; Let me
see you dance a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stood out into the garden-path, the stile being still
between them, and seizing a side of her skirt with each hand,
performed the movements which are even yet far from uncommon in
the dances of the villagers of merry England.&nbsp; But her
motions, though graceful, were not precisely those which appear
in the figures of a modern ball-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my good friend, it is a very pretty sight,&rsquo;
he said, warming up to the proceedings.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you
dance too well&mdash;you dance all over your person&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s too thorough a way for the present day.&nbsp; I
should say it was exactly how they danced in the time of your
poet Chaucer; but as people don&rsquo;t dance like it now, we
must consider.&nbsp; First I must inquire more about this ball,
and then I must see you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is a great trouble to you, sir,
I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no.&nbsp; I will think it over.&nbsp; So far so
good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Baron mentioned an evening and an hour when he would be
passing that way again; then mounted his horse and rode away.</p>
<p>On the next occasion, which was just when the sun was changing
places with the moon as an illuminator of Silverthorn Dairy, she
found him at the spot before her, and unencumbered by a
horse.&nbsp; The melancholy that had so weighed him down at their
first interview, and had been perceptible at their second, had
quite disappeared.&nbsp; He pressed her right hand between both
his own across the stile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good maiden, Gott bless you!&rsquo; said he
warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot help thinking of that
morning!&nbsp; I was too much over-shadowed at first to take in
the whole force of it.&nbsp; You do not know all; but your
presence was a miraculous intervention.&nbsp; Now to more
cheerful matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a great deal to
tell&mdash;that is, if your wish about the ball be still the
same?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, sir&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t object.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never think of my objecting.&nbsp; What I have found
out is something which simplifies matters amazingly.&nbsp; In
addition to your Yeomanry Ball at Exonbury, there is also to be
one in the next county about the same time.&nbsp; This ball is
not to be held at the Town Hall of the county-town as usual, but
at Lord Toneborough&rsquo;s, who is colonel of the regiment, and
who, I suppose, wishes to please the yeomen because his brother
is going to stand for the county.&nbsp; Now I find I could take
you there very well, and the great advantage of that ball over
the Yeomanry Ball in this county is, that there you would be
absolutely unknown, and I also.&nbsp; But do you prefer your own
neighbourhood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, sir.&nbsp; It is a ball I long to see&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what it is like; it does not matter
where.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good.&nbsp; Then I shall be able to make much more of
you there, where there is no possibility of recognition.&nbsp;
That being settled, the next thing is the dancing.&nbsp; Now
reels and such things do not do.&nbsp; For think of
this&mdash;there is a new dance at Almack&rsquo;s and everywhere
else, over which the world has gone crazy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How dreadful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;but that is a mere expression&mdash;gone
mad.&nbsp; It is really an ancient Scythian dance; but, such is
the power of fashion, that, having once been adopted by Society,
this dance has made the tour of the Continent in one
season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is its name, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The polka.&nbsp; Young people, who always dance, are
ecstatic about it, and old people, who have not danced for years,
have begun to dance again, on its account.&nbsp; All share the
excitement.&nbsp; It arrived in London only some few months
ago&mdash;it is now all over the country.&nbsp; Now this is your
opportunity, my good Margery.&nbsp; To learn this one dance will
be enough.&nbsp; They will dance scarce anything else at that
ball.&nbsp; While, to crown all, it is the easiest dance in the
world, and as I know it quite well I can practise you in the
step.&nbsp; Suppose we try?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery showed some hesitation before crossing the stile: it
was a Rubicon in more ways than one.&nbsp; But the curious
reverence which was stealing over her for all that this stranger
said and did was too much for prudence.&nbsp; She crossed the
stile.</p>
<p>Withdrawing with her to a nook where two high hedges met, and
where the grass was elastic and dry, he lightly rested his arm on
her waist, and practised with her the new step of
fascination.&nbsp; Instead of music he whispered numbers, and
she, as may be supposed, showed no slight aptness in following
his instructions.&nbsp; Thus they moved round together, the
moon-shadows from the twigs racing over their forms as they
turned.</p>
<p>The interview lasted about half an hour.&nbsp; Then he
somewhat abruptly handed her over the stile and stood looking at
her from the other side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he murmured, &lsquo;what has come to pass
is strange!&nbsp; My whole business after this will be to recover
my right mind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery always declared that there seemed to be some power in
the stranger that was more than human, something magical and
compulsory, when he seized her and gently trotted her
round.&nbsp; But lingering emotions may have led her memory to
play pranks with the scene, and her vivid imagination at that
youthful age must be taken into account in believing her.&nbsp;
However, there is no doubt that the stranger, whoever he might
be, and whatever his powers, taught her the elements of modern
dancing at a certain interview by moonlight at the top of her
father&rsquo;s garden, as was proved by her possession of
knowledge on the subject that could have been acquired in no
other way.</p>
<p>His was of the first rank of commanding figures, she was one
of the most agile of milkmaids, and to casual view it would have
seemed all of a piece with Nature&rsquo;s doings that things
should go on thus.&nbsp; But there was another side to the case;
and whether the strange gentleman were a wild olive tree, or not,
it was questionable if the acquaintance would lead to
happiness.&nbsp; &lsquo;A fleeting romance and a possible
calamity;&rsquo; thus it might have been summed up by the
practical.</p>
<p>Margery was in Paradise; and yet she was not at this date
distinctly in love with the stranger.&nbsp; What she felt was
something more mysterious, more of the nature of
veneration.&nbsp; As he looked at her across the stile she spoke
timidly, on a subject which had apparently occupied her long.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought to have a ball-dress, ought I not,
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; And you shall have a
ball-dress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt of it.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t do things by halves
for my best friend.&nbsp; I have thought of the ball-dress, and
of other things also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is my dancing good enough?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite&mdash;quite.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused, lapsed into
thought, and looked at her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Margery,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;do you trust yourself unreservedly to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, sir,&rsquo; she replied brightly; &lsquo;if I am
not too much trouble: if I am good enough to be seen in your
society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Baron laughed in a peculiar way.&nbsp; &lsquo;Really, I
think you may assume as much as that.&mdash;However, to
business.&nbsp; The ball is on the twenty-fifth, that is next
Thursday week; and the only difficulty about the dress is the
size.&nbsp; Suppose you lend me this?&rsquo;&nbsp; And he touched
her on the shoulder to signify a tight little jacket she
wore.</p>
<p>Margery was all obedience.&nbsp; She took it off and handed it
to him.&nbsp; The Baron rolled and compressed it with all his
force till it was about as large as an apple-dumpling, and put it
into his pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next thing,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is about getting
the consent of your friends to your going.&nbsp; Have you thought
of this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is only my father.&nbsp; I can tell him I am
invited to a party, and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll
mind.&nbsp; Though I would rather not tell him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it strikes me that you must inform him something of
what you intend.&nbsp; I would strongly advise you to do
so.&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke as if rather perplexed as to the
probable custom of the English peasantry in such matters, and
added, &lsquo;However, it is for you to decide.&nbsp; I know
nothing of the circumstances.&nbsp; As to getting to the ball,
the plan I have arranged is this.&nbsp; The direction to Lord
Toneborough&rsquo;s being the other way from my house, you must
meet me at Three-Walks-End&mdash;in Chillington Wood, two miles
or more from here.&nbsp; You know the place?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; By
meeting there we shall save five or six miles of journey&mdash;a
consideration, as it is a long way.&nbsp; Now, for the last time:
are you still firm in your wish for this particular treat and no
other?&nbsp; It is not too late to give it up.&nbsp; Cannot you
think of something else&mdash;something better&mdash;some useful
household articles you require?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery&rsquo;s countenance, which before had been beaming
with expectation, lost its brightness: her lips became close, and
her voice broken.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have offered to take me, and
now&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no,&rsquo; he said, patting her cheek.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We will not think of anything else.&nbsp; You shall
go.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>But whether the Baron, in naming such a distant spot for the
rendezvous, was in hope she might fail him, and so relieve him
after all of his undertaking, cannot be said; though it might
have been strongly suspected from his manner that he had no great
zest for the responsibility of escorting her.</p>
<p>But he little knew the firmness of the young woman he had to
deal with.&nbsp; She was one of those soft natures whose power of
adhesiveness to an acquired idea seems to be one of the special
attributes of that softness.&nbsp; To go to a ball with this
mysterious personage of romance was her ardent desire and aim;
and none the less in that she trembled with fear and excitement
at her position in so aiming.&nbsp; She felt the deepest awe,
tenderness, and humility towards the Baron of the strange name;
and yet she was prepared to stick to her point.</p>
<p>Thus it was that the afternoon of the eventful day found
Margery trudging her way up the slopes from the vale to the place
of appointment.&nbsp; She walked to the music of innumerable
birds, which increased as she drew away from the open meads
towards the groves.</p>
<p>She had overcome all difficulties.&nbsp; After thinking out
the question of telling or not telling her father, she had
decided that to tell him was to be forbidden to go.&nbsp; Her
contrivance therefore was this: to leave home this evening on a
visit to her invalid grandmother, who lived not far from the
Baron&rsquo;s house; but not to arrive at her grandmother&rsquo;s
till breakfast-time next morning.&nbsp; Who would suspect an
intercalated experience of twelve hours with the Baron at a
ball?&nbsp; That this piece of deception was indefensible she
afterwards owned readily enough; but she did not stop to think of
it then.</p>
<p>It was sunset within Chillington Wood by the time she reached
Three-Walks-End&mdash;the converging point of radiating
trackways, now floored with a carpet of matted grass, which had
never known other scythes than the teeth of rabbits and
hares.&nbsp; The twitter overhead had ceased, except from a few
braver and larger birds, including the cuckoo, who did not fear
night at this pleasant time of year.&nbsp; Nobody seemed to be on
the spot when she first drew near, but no sooner did Margery
stand at the intersection of the roads than a slight crashing
became audible, and her patron appeared.&nbsp; He was so
transfigured in dress that she scarcely knew him.&nbsp; Under a
light great-coat, which was flung open, instead of his ordinary
clothes he wore a suit of thin black cloth, an open waistcoat
with a frill all down his shirt-front, a white tie, shining
boots, no thicker than a glove, a coat that made him look like a
bird, and a hat that seemed as if it would open and shut like an
accordion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am dressed for the ball&mdash;nothing worse,&rsquo;
he said, drily smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;So will you be
soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you choose this place for our meeting,
sir?&rsquo; she asked, looking around and acquiring
confidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did I choose it?&nbsp; Well, because in riding past
one day I observed a large hollow tree close by here, and it
occurred to me when I was last with you that this would be useful
for our purpose.&nbsp; Have you told your father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not yet told him, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very bad of you, Margery.&nbsp; How have
you arranged it, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She briefly related her plan, on which he made no comment,
but, taking her by the hand as if she were a little child, he led
her through the undergrowth to a spot where the trees were older,
and standing at wider distances.&nbsp; Among them was the tree he
had spoken of&mdash;an elm; huge, hollow, distorted, and
headless, with a rift in its side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now go inside,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;before it gets
any darker.&nbsp; You will find there everything you want.&nbsp;
At any rate, if you do not you must do without it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll keep watch; and don&rsquo;t be longer than you can
help to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What am I to do, sir?&rsquo; asked the puzzled
maiden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go inside, and you will see.&nbsp; When you are ready
wave your handkerchief at that hole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stooped into the opening.&nbsp; The cavity within the tree
formed a lofty circular apartment, four or five feet in diameter,
to which daylight entered at the top, and also through a round
hole about six feet from the ground, marking the spot at which a
limb had been amputated in the tree&rsquo;s prime.&nbsp; The
decayed wood of cinnamon-brown, forming the inner surface of the
tree, and the warm evening glow, reflected in at the top,
suffused the cavity with a faint mellow radiance.</p>
<p>But Margery had hardly given herself time to heed these
things.&nbsp; Her eye had been caught by objects of quite another
quality.&nbsp; A large white oblong paper box lay against the
inside of the tree; over it, on a splinter, hung a small oval
looking-glass.</p>
<p>Margery seized the idea in a moment.&nbsp; She pressed through
the rift into the tree, lifted the cover of the box, and, behold,
there was disclosed within a lovely white apparition in a
somewhat flattened state.&nbsp; It was the ball-dress.</p>
<p>This marvel of art was, briefly, a sort of heavenly
cobweb.&nbsp; It was a gossamer texture of precious manufacture,
artistically festooned in a dozen flounces or more.</p>
<p>Margery lifted it, and could hardly refrain from kissing
it.&nbsp; Had any one told her before this moment that such a
dress could exist, she would have said, &lsquo;No; it&rsquo;s
impossible!&rsquo;&nbsp; She drew back, went forward, flushed,
laughed, raised her hands.&nbsp; To say that the maker of that
dress had been an individual of talent was simply understatement:
he was a genius, and she sunned herself in the rays of his
creation.</p>
<p>She then remembered that her friend without had told her to
make haste, and she spasmodically proceeded to array
herself.&nbsp; In removing the dress she found satin slippers,
gloves, a handkerchief nearly all lace, a fan, and even flowers
for the hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, how could he think of it!&rsquo;
she said, clasping her hands and almost crying with
agitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the glass&mdash;how good of
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everything was so well prepared, that to clothe herself in
these garments was a matter of ease.&nbsp; In a quarter of an
hour she was ready, even to shoes and gloves.&nbsp; But what led
her more than anything else into admiration of the Baron&rsquo;s
foresight was the discovery that there were half-a-dozen pairs
each of shoes and gloves, of varying sizes, out of which she
selected a fit.</p>
<p>Margery glanced at herself in the mirror, or at as much as she
could see of herself: the image presented was superb.&nbsp; Then
she hastily rolled up her old dress, put it in the box, and
thrust the latter on a ledge as high as she could reach.&nbsp;
Standing on tiptoe, she waved the handkerchief through the upper
aperture, and bent to the rift to go out.</p>
<p>But what a trouble stared her in the face.&nbsp; The dress was
so airy, so fantastical, and so extensive, that to get out in her
new clothes by the rift which had admitted her in her old ones
was an impossibility.&nbsp; She heard the Baron&rsquo;s steps
crackling over the dead sticks and leaves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, sir!&rsquo; she began in despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;can&rsquo;t you dress yourself?&rsquo; he
inquired from the back of the trunk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but I can&rsquo;t get out of this dreadful
tree!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He came round to the opening, stooped, and looked in.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is obvious that you cannot,&rsquo; he said, taking in
her compass at a glance; and adding to himself; &lsquo;Charming!
who would have thought that clothes could do so much!&mdash;Wait
a minute, my little maid: I have it!&rsquo; he said more
loudly.</p>
<p>With all his might he kicked at the sides of the rift, and by
that means broke away several pieces of the rotten
touchwood.&nbsp; But, being thinly armed about the feet, he
abandoned that process, and went for a fallen branch which lay
near.&nbsp; By using the large end as a lever, he tore away
pieces of the wooden shell which enshrouded Margery and all her
loveliness, till the aperture was large enough for her to pass
without tearing her dress.&nbsp; She breathed her relief: the
silly girl had begun to fear that she would not get to the ball
after all.</p>
<p>He carefully wrapped round her a cloak he had brought with
him: it was hooded, and of a length which covered her to the
heels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The carriage is waiting down the other path,&rsquo; he
said, and gave her his arm.&nbsp; A short trudge over the soft
dry leaves brought them to the place indicated.</p>
<p>There stood the brougham, the horses, the coachman, all as
still as if they were growing on the spot, like the trees.&nbsp;
Margery&rsquo;s eyes rose with some timidity to the
coachman&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not mind him,&rsquo; said the Baron.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is a foreigner, and heeds nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the space of a short minute she was handed inside; the
Baron buttoned up his overcoat, and surprised her by mounting
with the coachman.&nbsp; The carriage moved off silently over the
long grass of the vista, the shadows deepening to black as they
proceeded.&nbsp; Darker and darker grew the night as they rolled
on; the neighbourhood familiar to Margery was soon left behind,
and she had not the remotest idea of the direction they were
taking.&nbsp; The stars blinked out, the coachman lit his lamps,
and they bowled on again.</p>
<p>In the course of an hour and a half they arrived at a small
town, where they pulled up at the chief inn, and changed horses;
all being done so readily that their advent had plainly been
expected.&nbsp; The journey was resumed immediately.&nbsp; Her
companion never descended to speak to her; whenever she looked
out there he sat upright on his perch, with the mien of a person
who had a difficult duty to perform, and who meant to perform it
properly at all costs.&nbsp; But Margery could not help feeling a
certain dread at her situation&mdash;almost, indeed, a wish that
she had not come.&nbsp; Once or twice she thought, &lsquo;Suppose
he is a wicked man, who is taking me off to a foreign country,
and will never bring me home again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But her characteristic persistence in an original idea
sustained her against these misgivings except at odd
moments.&nbsp; One incident in particular had given her
confidence in her escort: she had seen a tear in his eye when she
expressed her sorrow for his troubles.&nbsp; He may have divined
that her thoughts would take an uneasy turn, for when they
stopped for a moment in ascending a hill he came to the
window.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you tired, Margery?&rsquo; he asked
kindly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you afraid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;N&mdash;no, sir.&nbsp; But it is a long way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are almost there,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And now, Margery,&rsquo; he said in a lower tone, &lsquo;I
must tell you a secret.&nbsp; I have obtained this invitation in
a peculiar way.&nbsp; I thought it best for your sake not to come
in my own name, and this is how I have managed.&nbsp; A man in
this county, for whom I have lately done a service, one whom I
can trust, and who is personally as unknown here as you and I,
has (privately) transferred his card of invitation to me.&nbsp;
So that we go under his name.&nbsp; I explain this that you may
not say anything imprudent by accident.&nbsp; Keep your ears open
and be cautious.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having said this the Baron
retreated again to his place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he is a wicked man after all!&rsquo; she said to
herself; &lsquo;for he is going under a false name.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But she soon had the temerity not to mind it: wickedness of that
sort was the one ingredient required just now to finish him off
as a hero in her eyes.</p>
<p>They descended a hill, passed a lodge, then up an avenue; and
presently there beamed upon them the light from other carriages,
drawn up in a file, which moved on by degrees; and at last they
halted before a large arched doorway, round which a group of
people stood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are among the latest arrivals, on account of the
distance,&rsquo; said the Baron, reappearing.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
never mind; there are three hours at least for your
enjoyment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The steps were promptly flung down, and they alighted.&nbsp;
The steam from the flanks of their swarthy steeds, as they seemed
to her, ascended to the parapet of the porch, and from their
nostrils the hot breath jetted forth like smoke out of volcanoes,
attracting the attention of all.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>The bewildered Margery was led by the Baron up the steps to
the interior of the house, whence the sounds of music and dancing
were already proceeding.&nbsp; The tones were strange.&nbsp; At
every fourth beat a deep and mighty note throbbed through the
air, reaching Margery&rsquo;s soul with all the force of a
blow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that powerful tune, sir&mdash;I have never
heard anything like it?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Drum Polka,&rsquo; answered the Baron.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The strange dance I spoke of and that we
practised&mdash;introduced from my country and other parts of the
continent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her surprise was not lessened when, at the entrance to the
ballroom, she heard the names of her conductor and herself
announced as &lsquo;Mr. and Miss Brown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, nobody seemed to take any notice of the announcement,
the room beyond being in a perfect turmoil of gaiety, and
Margery&rsquo;s consternation at sailing under false colours
subsided.&nbsp; At the same moment she observed awaiting them a
handsome, dark-haired, rather <i>petite</i> lady in
cream-coloured satin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is she?&rsquo; asked
Margery of the Baron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is the lady of the mansion,&rsquo; he
whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is the wife of a peer of the realm,
the daughter of a marquis, has five Christian names; and hardly
ever speaks to commoners, except for political
purposes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How divine&mdash;what joy to be here!&rsquo; murmured
Margery, as she contemplated the diamonds that flashed from the
head of her ladyship, who was just inside the ball-room door, in
front of a little gilded chair, upon which she sat in the
intervals between one arrival and another.&nbsp; She had come
down from London at great inconvenience to herself; openly to
promote this entertainment.</p>
<p>As Mr. and Miss Brown expressed absolutely no meaning to Lady
Toneborough (for there were three Browns already present in this
rather mixed assembly), and as there was possibly a slight
awkwardness in poor Margery&rsquo;s manner, Lady Toneborough
touched their hands lightly with the tips of her long gloves,
said, &lsquo;How d&rsquo;ye do,&rsquo; and turned round for more
comers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, if she only knew we were a rich Baron and his
friend, and not Mr. and Miss Brown at all, she wouldn&rsquo;t
receive us like that, would she?&rsquo; whispered Margery
confidentially.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, she wouldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; drily said the
Baron.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now let us drop into the dance at once; some
of the people here, you see, dance much worse than
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Almost before she was aware she had obeyed his mysterious
influence, by giving him one hand, placing the other upon his
shoulder, and swinging with him round the room to the steps she
had learnt on the sward.</p>
<p>At the first gaze the apartment had seemed to her to be
floored with black ice; the figures of the dancers appearing upon
it upside down.&nbsp; At last she realized that it was
highly-polished oak, but she was none the less afraid to
move.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid of falling down,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lean on me; you will soon get used to it,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have no nails in your shoes now,
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His words, like all his words to her, were quite true.&nbsp;
She found it amazingly easy in a brief space of time.&nbsp; The
floor, far from hindering her, was a positive assistance to one
of her natural agility and litheness.&nbsp; Moreover, her
marvellous dress of twelve flounces inspired her as nothing else
could have done.&nbsp; Externally a new creature, she was
prompted to new deeds.&nbsp; To feel as well-dressed as the other
women around her is to set any woman at her ease, whencesoever
she may have come: to feel much better dressed is to add radiance
to that ease.</p>
<p>Her prophet&rsquo;s statement on the popularity of the polka
at this juncture was amply borne out.&nbsp; It was among the
first seasons of its general adoption in country houses; the
enthusiasm it excited to-night was beyond description, and
scarcely credible to the youth of the present day.&nbsp; A new
motive power had been introduced into the world of
poesy&mdash;the polka, as a counterpoise to the new motive power
that had been introduced into the world of prose&mdash;steam.</p>
<p>Twenty finished musicians sat in the music gallery at the end,
with romantic mop-heads of raven hair, under which their faces
and eyes shone like fire under coals.</p>
<p>The nature and object of the ball had led to its being very
inclusive.&nbsp; Every rank was there, from the peer to the
smallest yeoman, and Margery got on exceedingly well,
particularly when the recuperative powers of supper had banished
the fatigue of her long drive.</p>
<p>Sometimes she heard people saying, &lsquo;Who are
they?&mdash;brother and sister&mdash;father and daughter?&nbsp;
And never dancing except with each other&mdash;how
odd?&rsquo;&nbsp; But of this she took no notice.</p>
<p>When not dancing the watchful Baron took her through the
drawing-rooms and picture-galleries adjoining, which to-night
were thrown open like the rest of the house; and there,
ensconcing her in some curtained nook, he drew her attention to
scrap-books, prints, and albums, and left her to amuse herself
with turning them over till the dance in which she was practised
should again be called.&nbsp; Margery would much have preferred
to roam about during these intervals; but the words of the Baron
were law, and as he commanded so she acted.&nbsp; In such
alternations the evening winged away; till at last came the
gloomy words, &lsquo;Margery, our time is up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One more&mdash;only one!&rsquo; she coaxed, for the
longer they stayed the more freely and gaily moved the
dance.&nbsp; This entreaty he granted; but on her asking for yet
another, he was inexorable.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have a long way to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she bade adieu to the wondrous scene, looking over her
shoulder as they withdrew from the hall; and in a few minutes she
was cloaked and in the carriage.&nbsp; The Baron mounted to his
seat on the box, where she saw him light a cigar; they plunged
under the trees, and she leant back, and gave herself up to
contemplate the images that filled her brain.&nbsp; The natural
result followed: she fell asleep.</p>
<p>She did not awake till they stopped to change horses; when she
saw against the stars the Baron sitting as erect as ever.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He watches like the Angel Gabriel, when all the world is
asleep!&rsquo; she thought.</p>
<p>With the resumption of motion she slept again, and knew no
more till he touched her hand and said, &lsquo;Our journey is
done&mdash;we are in Chillington Wood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was almost daylight.&nbsp; Margery scarcely knew herself to
be awake till she was out of the carriage and standing beside the
Baron, who, having told the coachman to drive on to a certain
point indicated, turned to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he said, smiling, &lsquo;run across to the
hollow tree; you know where it is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wait as
before, while you perform the reverse operation to that you did
last night.&rsquo;&nbsp; She took no heed of the path now, nor
regarded whether her pretty slippers became scratched by the
brambles or no.&nbsp; A walk of a few steps brought her to the
particular tree which she had left about nine hours
earlier.&nbsp; It was still gloomy at this spot, the morning not
being clear.</p>
<p>She entered the trunk, dislodged the box containing her old
clothing, pulled off the satin shoes, and gloves, dress, and in
ten minutes emerged in the cotton and shawl of shepherd&rsquo;s
plaid.</p>
<p>Baron was not far off.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now you look the milkmaid
again,&rsquo; he said, coming towards her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is
the finery?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Packed in the box, sir, as I found it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
spoke with more humility now.&nbsp; The difference between them
was greater than it had been at the ball.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must just dispose
of it; and then away we go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went back to the tree, Margery following at a little
distance.&nbsp; Bringing forth the box, he pulled out the dress
as carelessly as if it had been rags.&nbsp; But this was not
all.&nbsp; He gathered a few dry sticks, crushed the lovely
garment into a loose billowy heap, threw the gloves, fan, and
shoes on the top, then struck a light and ruthlessly set fire to
the whole.</p>
<p>Margery was agonized.&nbsp; She ran forward; she implored and
entreated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please, sir&mdash;do spare
it&mdash;do!&nbsp; My lovely dress&mdash;my-dear, dear
slippers&mdash;my fan&mdash;it is cruel!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t burn
them, please!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense.&nbsp; We shall have no further use for them
if we live a hundred years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But spare a bit of it&mdash;one little piece,
sir&mdash;a scrap of the lace&mdash;one bow of the
ribbon&mdash;the lovely fan&mdash;just something!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he was as immoveable as Rhadamanthus.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, with a stern gaze of his aristocratic
eye.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is of no use for you to speak like
that.&nbsp; The things are my property.&nbsp; I undertook to
gratify you in what you might desire because you had saved my
life.&nbsp; To go to a ball, you said.&nbsp; You might much more
wisely have said anything else, but no; you said, to go to a
ball.&nbsp; Very well&mdash;I have taken you to a ball.&nbsp; I
have brought you back.&nbsp; The clothes were only the means, and
I dispose of them my own way.&nbsp; Have I not a right
to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; she said meekly.</p>
<p>He gave the fire a stir, and lace and ribbons, and the twelve
flounces, and the embroidery, and all the rest crackled and
disappeared.&nbsp; He then put in her hands the butter basket she
had brought to take on to her grandmother&rsquo;s, and
accompanied her to the edge of the wood, where it merged in the
undulating open country in which her granddame dwelt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Margery,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;here we
part.&nbsp; I have performed my contract&mdash;at some
awkwardness, if I was recognized.&nbsp; But never mind
that.&nbsp; How do you feel&mdash;sleepy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, sir,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That long nap refreshed you, eh?&nbsp; Now you must
make me a promise.&nbsp; That if I require your presence at any
time, you will come to me . . . I am a man of more than one
mood,&rsquo; he went on with sudden solemnity; &lsquo;and I may
have desperate need of you again, to deliver me from that
darkness as of Death which sometimes encompasses me.&nbsp;
Promise it, Margery&mdash;promise it; that, no matter what stands
in the way, you will come to me if I require you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would have if you had not burnt my pretty
clothes!&rsquo; she pouted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;ungrateful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, then, I will promise, sir,&rsquo; she said from
her heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wherever I am, if I have bodily strength
I will come to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pressed her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a solemn
promise,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I must go, for you
know your way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall hardly believe that it has not been all a
dream!&rsquo; she said, with a childish instinct to cry at his
withdrawal.&nbsp; &lsquo;There will be nothing left of last
night&mdash;nothing of my dress, nothing of my pleasure, nothing
of the place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall remember it in this way,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll cut our initials on this tree as a
memorial, so that whenever you walk this path you will see
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then with a knife he inscribed on the smooth bark of a beech
tree the letters M.T., and underneath a large X.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, have you no Christian name, sir?&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t use it.&nbsp; Now, good-bye, my
little friend.&mdash;What will you do with yourself to-day, when
you are gone from me?&rsquo; he lingered to ask.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;I shall go to my granny&rsquo;s,&rsquo; she
replied with some gloom; &lsquo;and have breakfast, and dinner,
and tea with her, I suppose; and in the evening I shall go home
to Silverthorn Dairy, and perhaps Jim will come to meet me, and
all will be the same as usual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is Jim?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, he&rsquo;s nobody&mdash;only the young man
I&rsquo;ve got to marry some day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&mdash;you engaged to be married?&mdash;Why
didn&rsquo;t you tell me this before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the young man&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;James Hayward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A master lime-burner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Engaged to a master lime-burner, and not a word of this
to me!&nbsp; Margery, Margery! when shall a straightforward one
of your sex be found!&nbsp; Subtle even in your simplicity!&nbsp;
What mischief have you caused me to do, through not telling me
this?&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have so endangered anybody&rsquo;s
happiness for a thousand pounds.&nbsp; Wicked girl that you were;
why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I&rsquo;d better not!&rsquo; said Margery,
beginning to be frightened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you see and understand that if you are
already the property of a young man, and he were to find out this
night&rsquo;s excursion, he may be angry with you and part from
you for ever?&nbsp; With him already in the field I had no right
to take you at all; he undoubtedly ought to have taken you; which
really might have been arranged, if you had not deceived me by
saying you had nobody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery&rsquo;s face wore that aspect of woe which comes from
the repentant consciousness of having been guilty of an
enormity.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he wasn&rsquo;t good enough to take
me, sir!&rsquo; she said, almost crying; &lsquo;and he
isn&rsquo;t absolutely my master until I have married him, is
he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a subject I cannot go into.&nbsp; However,
we must alter our tactics.&nbsp; Instead of advising you, as I
did at first, to tell of this experience to your friends, I must
now impress on you that it will be best to keep a silent tongue
on the matter&mdash;perhaps for ever and ever.&nbsp; It may come
right some day, and you may be able to say &ldquo;All&rsquo;s
well that ends well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, good morning, my
friend.&nbsp; Think of Jim, and forget me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, perhaps I can&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; she said,
with a tear in her eye, and a full throat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;do your best.&nbsp; I can say no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned and retreated into the wood, and Margery, sighing,
went on her way.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>Between six and seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening of the same
day a young man descended the hills into the valley of the Exe,
at a point about midway between Silverthorn and the residence of
Margery&rsquo;s grandmother, four miles to the east.</p>
<p>He was a thoroughbred son of the country, as far removed from
what is known as the provincial, as the latter is from the
out-and-out gentleman of culture.&nbsp; His trousers and
waistcoat were of fustian, almost white, but he wore a jacket of
old-fashioned blue West-of-England cloth, so well preserved that
evidently the article was relegated to a box whenever its owner
engaged in such active occupations as he usually pursued.&nbsp;
His complexion was fair, almost florid, and he had scarcely any
beard.</p>
<p>A novel attraction about this young man, which a glancing
stranger would know nothing of, was a rare and curious freshness
of atmosphere that appertained to him, to his clothes, to all his
belongings, even to the room in which he had been sitting.&nbsp;
It might almost have been said that by adding him and his
implements to an over-crowded apartment you made it
healthful.&nbsp; This resulted from his trade.&nbsp; He was a
lime-burner; he handled lime daily; and in return the lime
rendered him an incarnation of salubrity.&nbsp; His hair was dry,
fair, and frizzled, the latter possibly by the operation of the
same caustic agent.&nbsp; He carried as a walking-stick a green
sapling, whose growth had been contorted to a corkscrew pattern
by a twining honeysuckle.</p>
<p>As he descended to the level ground of the water-meadows he
cast his glance westward, with a frequency that revealed him to
be in search of some object in the distance.&nbsp; It was rather
difficult to do this, the low sunlight dazzling his eyes by
glancing from the river away there, and from the
&lsquo;carriers&rsquo; (as they were called) in his
path&mdash;narrow artificial brooks for conducting the water over
the grass.&nbsp; His course was something of a zigzag from the
necessity of finding points in these carriers convenient for
jumping.&nbsp; Thus peering and leaping and winding, he drew near
the Exe, the central river of the miles-long mead.</p>
<p>A moving spot became visible to him in the direction of his
scrutiny, mixed up with the rays of the same river.&nbsp; The
spot got nearer, and revealed itself to be a slight thing of pink
cotton and shepherd&rsquo;s plaid, which pursued a path on the
brink of the stream.&nbsp; The young man so shaped his trackless
course as to impinge on the path a little ahead of this coloured
form, and when he drew near her he smiled and reddened.&nbsp; The
girl smiled back to him; but her smile had not the life in it
that the young man&rsquo;s had shown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Margery&mdash;here I am!&rsquo; he said gladly
in an undertone, as with a last leap he crossed the last
intervening carrier, and stood at her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve come all the way from the kiln, on purpose
to meet me, and you shouldn&rsquo;t have done it,&rsquo; she
reproachfully returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We finished there at four, so it was no trouble; and if
it had been&mdash;why, I should ha&rsquo; come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A small sigh was the response.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, you are not even so glad to see me as you would
be to see your dog or cat?&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, Mis&rsquo;ess Margery, this is rather hard.&nbsp;
But, by George, how tired you dew look!&nbsp; Why, if you&rsquo;d
been up all night your eyes couldn&rsquo;t be more like
tea-saucers.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve walked tew far, that&rsquo;s what
it is.&nbsp; The weather is getting warm now, and the air of
these low-lying meads is not strengthening in summer.&nbsp; I
wish you lived up on higher ground with me, beside the
kiln.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d get as strong as a hoss!&nbsp; Well,
there; all that will come in time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead of saying yes, the fair maid repressed another
sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, won&rsquo;t it, then?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose so,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it
is to be, it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said&mdash;very well said, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if it isn&rsquo;t to be it isn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s been putting that into your
head?&nbsp; Your grumpy granny, I suppose.&nbsp; However, how is
she?&nbsp; Margery, I have been thinking to-day&mdash;in fact, I
was thinking it yesterday and all the week&mdash;that really we
might settle our little business this summer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This summer?&rsquo; she repeated, with some
dismay.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the partnership?&nbsp; Remember it was
not to be till after that was completed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There I have you!&rsquo; said he, taking the liberty to
pat her shoulder, and the further liberty of advancing his hand
behind it to the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;The partnership is
settled.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis &ldquo;Vine and Hayward,
lime-burners,&rdquo; now, and &ldquo;Richard Vine&rdquo; no
longer.&nbsp; Yes, Cousin Richard has settled it so, for a time
at least, and &rsquo;tis to be painted on the carts this
week&mdash;blue letters&mdash;yaller ground.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
boss one of &rsquo;em, and drive en round to your door as soon as
the paint is dry, to show &rsquo;ee how it looks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am sure you needn&rsquo;t take that trouble, Jim;
I can see it quite well enough in my mind,&rsquo; replied the
young girl&mdash;not without a flitting accent of
superiority.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo,&rsquo; said Jim, taking her by the shoulders,
and looking at her hard.&nbsp; &lsquo;What dew that bit of
incivility mean?&nbsp; Now, Margery, let&rsquo;s sit down here,
and have this cleared.&rsquo;&nbsp; He rapped with his stick upon
the rail of a little bridge they were crossing, and seated
himself firmly, leaving a place for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I want to get home-along,&rsquo; dear Jim, she
coaxed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fidgets.&nbsp; Sit down, there&rsquo;s a dear.&nbsp; I
want a straightforward answer, if you please.&nbsp; In what
month, and on what day of the month, will you marry
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Jim,&rsquo; she said, sitting gingerly on the edge,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s too plain-spoken for you yet.&nbsp; Before I
look at it in that business light I should have
to&mdash;to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your father has settled it long ago, and you said
it should be as soon as I became a partner.&nbsp; So, dear, you
must not mind a plain man wanting a plain answer.&nbsp; Come,
name your time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not reply at once.&nbsp; What thoughts were passing
through her brain during the interval?&nbsp; Not images raised by
his words, but whirling figures of men and women in red and white
and blue, reflected from a glassy floor, in movements timed by
the thrilling beats of the Drum Polka.&nbsp; At last she said
slowly, &lsquo;Jim, you don&rsquo;t know the world, and what a
woman&rsquo;s wants can be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I can make you comfortable.&nbsp; I am in lodgings
as yet, but I can have a house for the asking; and as to
furniture, you shall choose of the best for yourself&mdash;the
very best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The best!&nbsp; Far are you from knowing what that
is!&rsquo; said the little woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;There be ornaments
such as you never dream of; work-tables that would set you in
amaze; silver candlesticks, tea and coffee pots that would dazzle
your eyes; tea-cups, and saucers, gilded all over with
guinea-gold; heavy velvet curtains, gold clocks, pictures, and
looking-glasses beyond your very dreams.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t say
I shall have the best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; said Jim gloomily; and fell into
reflection.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where did you get those high notions
from, Margery?&rsquo; he presently inquired.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll swear you hadn&rsquo;t got &rsquo;em a week
ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; She did not answer, and he added,
&lsquo;<i>Yew</i> don&rsquo;t expect to have such things, I hope;
deserve them as you may?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not exactly speaking of what I wanted,&rsquo; she
said severely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I said, things a woman <i>could</i>
want.&nbsp; And since you wish to know what I <i>can</i> want to
quite satisfy me, I assure you I can want those!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a pink-and-white conundrum, Margery,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;and I give you up for to-night.&nbsp; Anybody would
think the devil had showed you all the kingdoms of the world
since I saw you last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She reddened.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps he has!&rsquo; she
murmured; then arose, he following her; and they soon reached
Margery&rsquo;s home, approaching it from the lower or meadow
side&mdash;the opposite to that of the garden top, where she had
met the Baron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll come in, won&rsquo;t you, Jim?&rsquo; she
said, with more ceremony than heartiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;I think not to-night,&rsquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll consider what you&rsquo;ve
said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very good, Jim,&rsquo; she returned
lightly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>Jim thoughtfully retraced his steps.&nbsp; He was a village
character, and he had a villager&rsquo;s simplicity: that is, the
simplicity which comes from the lack of a complicated
experience.&nbsp; But simple by nature he certainly was
not.&nbsp; Among the rank and file of rustics he was quite a
Talleyrand, or rather had been one, till he lost a good deal of
his self-command by falling in love.</p>
<p>Now, however, that the charming object of his distraction was
out of sight he could deliberate, and measure, and weigh things
with some approach to keenness.&nbsp; The substance of his
queries was, What change had come over Margery&mdash;whence these
new notions?</p>
<p>Ponder as he would he could evolve no answer save one, which,
eminently unsatisfactory as it was, he felt it would be
unreasonable not to accept: that she was simply skittish and
ambitious by nature, and would not be hunted into matrimony till
he had provided a well-adorned home.</p>
<p>Jim retrod the miles to the kiln, and looked to the
fires.&nbsp; The kiln stood in a peculiar, interesting, even
impressive spot.&nbsp; It was at the end of a short ravine in a
limestone formation, and all around was an open hilly down.&nbsp;
The nearest house was that of Jim&rsquo;s cousin and partner,
which stood on the outskirts of the down beside the
turnpike-road.&nbsp; From this house a little lane wound between
the steep escarpments of the ravine till it reached the kiln,
which faced down the miniature valley, commanding it as a fort
might command a defile.</p>
<p>The idea of a fort in this association owed little to
imagination.&nbsp; For on the nibbled green steep above the kiln
stood a bye-gone, worn-out specimen of such an erection, huge,
impressive, and difficult to scale even now in its decay.&nbsp;
It was a British castle or entrenchment, with triple rings of
defence, rising roll behind roll, their outlines cutting sharply
against the sky, and Jim&rsquo;s kiln nearly undermining their
base.&nbsp; When the lime-kiln flared up in the night, which it
often did, its fires lit up the front of these ramparts to a
great majesty.&nbsp; They were old friends of his, and while
keeping up the heat through the long darkness, as it was
sometimes his duty to do, he would imagine the dancing lights and
shades about the stupendous earthwork to be the forms of those
giants who (he supposed) had heaped it up.&nbsp; Often he
clambered upon it, and walked about the summit, thinking out the
problems connected with his business, his partner, his future,
his Margery.</p>
<p>It was what he did this evening, continuing the meditation on
the young girl&rsquo;s manner that he had begun upon the road,
and still, as then, finding no clue to the change.</p>
<p>While thus engaged he observed a man coming up the ravine to
the kiln.&nbsp; Business messages were almost invariably left at
the house below, and Jim watched the man with the interest
excited by a belief that he had come on a personal matter.&nbsp;
On nearer approach Jim recognized him as the gardener at Mount
Lodge some miles away.&nbsp; If this meant business, the Baron
(of whose arrival Jim had vaguely heard) was a new and unexpected
customer.</p>
<p>It meant nothing else, apparently.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s
errand was simply to inform Jim that the Baron required a load of
lime for the garden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have saved yourself trouble by leaving word
at Mr. Vine&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was to see you personally,&rsquo; said the gardener,
&lsquo;and to say that the Baron would like to inquire of you
about the different qualities of lime proper for such
purposes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you tell him yourself?&rsquo; said
Jim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He said I was to tell you that,&rsquo; replied the
gardener; &lsquo;and it wasn&rsquo;t for me to
interfere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No motive other than the ostensible one could possibly be
conjectured by Jim Hayward at this time; and the next morning he
started with great pleasure, in his best business suit of
clothes.&nbsp; By eleven o&rsquo;clock he and his horse and cart
had arrived on the Baron&rsquo;s premises, and the lime was
deposited where directed; an exceptional spot, just within view
of the windows of the south front.</p>
<p>Baron von Xanten, pale and melancholy, was sauntering in the
sun on the slope between the house and the
all-the-year-round.&nbsp; He looked across to where Jim and the
gardener were standing, and the identity of Hayward being
established by what he brought, the Baron came down, and the
gardener withdrew.</p>
<p>The Baron&rsquo;s first inquiries were, as Jim had been led to
suppose they would be, on the exterminating effects of lime upon
slugs and snails in its different conditions of slaked and
unslaked, ground and in the lump.&nbsp; He appeared to be much
interested by Jim&rsquo;s explanations, and eyed the young man
closely whenever he had an opportunity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I hope trade is prosperous with you this
year,&rsquo; said the Baron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very, my noble lord,&rsquo; replied Jim, who, in his
uncertainty on the proper method of address, wisely concluded
that it was better to err by giving too much honour than by
giving too little.&nbsp; &lsquo;In short, trade is looking so
well that I&rsquo;ve become a partner in the firm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed; I am glad to hear it.&nbsp; So now you are
settled in life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my lord; I am hardly settled, even now.&nbsp; For
I&rsquo;ve got to finish it&mdash;I mean, to get
married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s an easy matter, compared with the
partnership.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now a man might think so, my baron,&rsquo; said Jim,
getting more confidential.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the real truth is,
&rsquo;tis the hardest part of all for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your suit prospers, I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Jim.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
don&rsquo;t at all just at present.&nbsp; In short, I can&rsquo;t
for the life o&rsquo; me think what&rsquo;s come over the young
woman lately.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he fell into deep reflection.</p>
<p>Though Jim did not observe it, the Baron&rsquo;s brow became
shadowed with self-reproach as he heard those simple words, and
his eyes had a look of pity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed&mdash;since
when?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since yesterday, my noble lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jim spoke
meditatively.&nbsp; He was resolving upon a bold stroke.&nbsp;
Why not make a confidant of this kind gentleman, instead of the
parson, as he had intended?&nbsp; The thought was no sooner
conceived than acted on.&nbsp; &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; he resumed,
&lsquo;I have heard that you are a nobleman of great scope and
talent, who has seen more strange countries and characters than I
have ever heard of, and know the insides of men well.&nbsp;
Therefore I would fain put a question to your noble lordship, if
I may so trouble you, and having nobody else in the world who
could inform me so trewly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any advice I can give is at your service,
Hayward.&nbsp; What do you wish to know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is this, my baron.&nbsp; What can I do to bring down
a young woman&rsquo;s ambition that&rsquo;s got to such a
towering height there&rsquo;s no reaching it or compassing it:
how get her to be pleased with me and my station as she used to
be when I first knew her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truly, that&rsquo;s a hard question, my man.&nbsp; What
does she aspire to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s got a craze for fine furniture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long has she had it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only just now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Baron seemed still more to experience regret.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What furniture does she specially covet?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silver candlesticks, work-tables, looking-glasses, gold
tea-things, silver tea-pots, gold clocks, curtains, pictures, and
I don&rsquo;t know what all&mdash;things I shall never get if I
live to be a hundred&mdash;not so much that I couldn&rsquo;t
raise the money to buy &rsquo;em, as that to put it to other
uses, or save it for a rainy day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think the possession of those articles would make
her happy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really think they might, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good.&nbsp; Open your pocket-book and write as I tell
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim in some astonishment did as commanded, and elevating his
pocket-book against the garden-wall, thoroughly moistened his
pencil, and wrote at the Baron&rsquo;s dictation:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pair of silver candlesticks: inlaid work-table and
work-box: one large mirror: two small ditto: one gilt china tea
and coffee service: one silver tea-pot, coffee-pot, sugar-basin,
jug, and dozen spoons: French clock: pair of curtains: six large
pictures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the Baron, &lsquo;tear out that leaf
and give it to me.&nbsp; Keep a close tongue about this; go home,
and don&rsquo;t be surprised at anything that may come to your
door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my noble lord, you don&rsquo;t mean that your
lordship is going to give&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind what I am going to do.&nbsp; Only keep your
own counsel.&nbsp; I perceive that, though a plain countryman,
you are by no means deficient in tact and understanding.&nbsp; If
sending these things to you gives me pleasure, why should you
object?&nbsp; The fact is, Hayward, I occasionally take an
interest in people, and like to do a little for them.&nbsp; I
take an interest in you.&nbsp; Now go home, and a week hence
invite Marg&mdash;the young woman and her father, to tea with
you.&nbsp; The rest is in your own hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A question often put to Jim in after times was why it had not
occurred to him at once that the Baron&rsquo;s liberal conduct
must have been dictated by something more personal than sudden
spontaneous generosity to him, a stranger.&nbsp; To which Jim
always answered that, admitting the existence of such generosity,
there had appeared nothing remarkable in the Baron selecting
himself as its object.&nbsp; The Baron had told him that he took
an interest in him; and self-esteem, even with the most modest,
is usually sufficient to over-ride any little difficulty that
might occur to an outsider in accounting for a preference.&nbsp;
He moreover considered that foreign noblemen, rich and eccentric,
might have habits of acting which were quite at variance with
those of their English compeers.</p>
<p>So he drove off homeward with a lighter heart than he had
known for several days.&nbsp; To have a foreign gentleman take a
fancy to him&mdash;what a triumph to a plain sort of fellow, who
had scarcely expected the Baron to look in his face.&nbsp; It
would be a fine story to tell Margery when the Baron gave him
liberty to speak out.</p>
<p>Jim lodged at the house of his cousin and partner, Richard
Vine, a widower of fifty odd years.&nbsp; Having failed in the
development of a household of direct descendants this tradesman
had been glad to let his chambers to his much younger relative,
when the latter entered on the business of lime manufacture; and
their intimacy had led to a partnership.&nbsp; Jim lived
upstairs; his partner lived down, and the furniture of all the
rooms was so plain and old fashioned as to excite the special
dislike of Miss Margery Tucker, and even to prejudice her against
Jim for tolerating it.&nbsp; Not only were the chairs and tables
queer, but, with due regard to the principle that a man&rsquo;s
surroundings should bear the impress of that man&rsquo;s life and
occupation, the chief ornaments of the dwelling were a curious
collection of calcinations, that had been discovered from time to
time in the lime-kiln&mdash;misshapen ingots of strange
substance, some of them like Pompeian remains.</p>
<p>The head of the firm was a quiet-living, narrow-minded, though
friendly, man of fifty; and he took a serious interest in
Jim&rsquo;s love-suit, frequently inquiring how it progressed,
and assuring Jim that if he chose to marry he might have all the
upper floor at a low rent, he, Mr. Vine, contenting himself
entirely with the ground level.&nbsp; It had been so convenient
for discussing business matters to have Jim in the same house,
that he did not wish any change to be made in consequence of a
change in Jim&rsquo;s domestic estate.&nbsp; Margery knew of this
wish, and of Jim&rsquo;s concurrent feeling; and did not like the
idea at all.</p>
<p>About four days after the young man&rsquo;s interview with the
Baron, there drew up in front of Jim&rsquo;s house at noon a
waggon laden with cases and packages, large and small.&nbsp; They
were all addressed to &lsquo;Mr. Hayward,&rsquo; and they had
come from the largest furnishing ware-houses in that part of
England.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of an hour were occupied in getting the cases
to Jim&rsquo;s rooms.&nbsp; The wary Jim did not show the
amazement he felt at his patron&rsquo;s munificence; and
presently the senior partner came into the passage, and wondered
what was lumbering upstairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;it&rsquo;s only some things of mine,&rsquo;
said Jim coolly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bearing upon the coming event&mdash;eh?&rsquo; said his
partner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; replied Jim.</p>
<p>Mr. Vine, with some astonishment at the number of cases,
shortly after went away to the kiln; whereupon Jim shut himself
into his rooms, and there he might have been heard ripping up and
opening boxes with a cautious hand, afterwards appearing outside
the door with them empty, and carrying them off to the
outhouse.</p>
<p>A triumphant look lit up his face when, a little later in the
afternoon, he sent into the vale to the dairy, and invited
Margery and her father to his house to supper.</p>
<p>She was not unsociable that day, and, her father expressing a
hard and fast acceptance of the invitation, she perforce agreed
to go with him.&nbsp; Meanwhile at home, Jim made himself as
mysteriously busy as before in those rooms of his, and when his
partner returned he too was asked to join in the supper.</p>
<p>At dusk Hayward went to the door, where he stood till he heard
the voices of his guests from the direction of the low grounds,
now covered with their frequent fleece of fog.&nbsp; The voices
grew more distinct, and then on the white surface of the fog
there appeared two trunkless heads, from which bodies and a horse
and cart gradually extended as the approaching pair rose towards
the house.</p>
<p>When they had entered Jim pressed Margery&rsquo;s hand and
conducted her up to his rooms, her father waiting below to say a
few words to the senior lime-burner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless me,&rsquo; said Jim to her, on entering the
sitting-room; &lsquo;I quite forgot to get a light beforehand;
but I&rsquo;ll have one in a jiffy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery stood in the middle of the dark room, while Jim struck
a match; and then the young girl&rsquo;s eyes were conscious of a
burst of light, and the rise into being of a pair of handsome
silver candlesticks containing two candles that Jim was in the
act of lighting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;where&mdash;you have candlesticks like
that?&rsquo; said Margery.&nbsp; Her eyes flew round the room as
the growing candle-flames showed other articles.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pictures too&mdash;and lovely china&mdash;why I knew
nothing of this, I declare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;a few things that came to me by
accident,&rsquo; said Jim in quiet tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a great gold clock under a glass, and a cupid
swinging for a pendulum; and O what a lovely
work-table&mdash;woods of every colour&mdash;and a work-box to
match.&nbsp; May I look inside that work-box, Jim?&mdash;whose is
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes; look at it, of course.&nbsp; It is a poor enough
thing, but &rsquo;tis mine; and it will belong to the woman I
marry, whoever she may be, as well as all the other things
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the curtains and the looking-glasses: why I declare
I can see myself in a hundred places.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That tea-set,&rsquo; said Jim, placidly pointing to a
gorgeous china service and a large silver tea-pot on the side
table, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t use at present, being a bachelor-man;
but, says I to myself, &ldquo;whoever I marry will want some such
things for giving her parties; or I can sell em&rdquo;&mdash;but
I haven&rsquo;t took steps for&rsquo;t yet&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sell &rsquo;em&mdash;no, I should think not,&rsquo;
said Margery with earnest reproach.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, I hope you
wouldn&rsquo;t be so foolish!&nbsp; Why, this is exactly the kind
of thing I was thinking of when I told you of the things women
could want&mdash;of course not meaning myself particularly.&nbsp;
I had no idea that you had such valuable&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery was unable to speak coherently, so much was she amazed
at the wealth of Jim&rsquo;s possessions.</p>
<p>At this moment her father and the lime-burner came upstairs;
and to appear womanly and proper to Mr. Vine, Margery repressed
the remainder of her surprise.</p>
<p>As for the two elderly worthies, it was not till they entered
the room and sat down that their slower eyes discerned anything
brilliant in the appointments.&nbsp; Then one of them stole a
glance at some article, and the other at another; but each being
unwilling to express his wonder in the presence of his
neighbours, they received the objects before them with quite an
accustomed air; the lime-burner inwardly trying to conjecture
what all this meant, and the dairyman musing that if Jim&rsquo;s
business allowed him to accumulate at this rate, the sooner
Margery became his wife the better.&nbsp; Margery retreated to
the work-table, work-box, and tea-service, which she examined
with hushed exclamations.</p>
<p>An entertainment thus surprisingly begun could not fail to
progress well.&nbsp; Whenever Margery&rsquo;s crusty old father
felt the need of a civil sentence, the flash of Jim&rsquo;s fancy
articles inspired him to one; while the lime-burner, having
reasoned away his first ominous thought that all this had come
out of the firm, also felt proud and blithe.</p>
<p>Jim accompanied his dairy friends part of the way home before
they mounted.&nbsp; Her father, finding that Jim wanted to speak
to her privately, and that she exhibited some elusiveness, turned
to Margery and said; &lsquo;Come, come, my lady; no more of this
nonsense.&nbsp; You just step behind with that young man, and I
and the cart will wait for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery, a little scared at her father&rsquo;s peremptoriness,
obeyed.&nbsp; It was plain that Jim had won the old man by that
night&rsquo;s stroke, if he had not won her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what you are going to say, Jim,&rsquo; she
began, less ardently now, for she was no longer under the novel
influence of the shining silver and glass.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, as
you desire it, and as my father desires it, and as I suppose it
will be the best course for me, I will fix the day&mdash;not this
evening, but as soon as I can think it over.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding a press of business, Jim went and did his duty
in thanking the Baron.&nbsp; The latter saw him in his
fishing-tackle room, an apartment littered with every appliance
that a votary of the rod could require.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when is the wedding-day to be, Hayward?&rsquo; the
Baron asked, after Jim had told him that matters were
settled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not quite certain yet, my noble lord,&rsquo; said
Jim cheerfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I hope &rsquo;twill not be long
after the time when God A&rsquo;mighty christens the little
apples.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when is that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;St. Swithin&rsquo;s&mdash;the middle of July.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis to be some time in that month, she tells
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Jim was gone the Baron seemed meditative.&nbsp; He went
out, ascended the mount, and entered the weather-screen, where he
looked at the seats, as though re-enacting in his fancy the scene
of that memorable morning of fog.&nbsp; He turned his eyes to the
angle of the shelter, round which Margery had suddenly appeared
like a vision, and it was plain that he would not have minded her
appearing there then.&nbsp; The juncture had indeed been such an
impressive and critical one that she must have seemed rather a
heavenly messenger than a passing milkmaid, more especially to a
man like the Baron, who, despite the mystery of his origin and
life, revealed himself to be a melancholy, emotional
character&mdash;the Jacques of this forest and stream.</p>
<p>Behind the mount the ground rose yet higher, ascending to a
plantation which sheltered the house.&nbsp; The Baron strolled up
here, and bent his gaze over the distance.&nbsp; The valley of
the Exe lay before him, with its shining river, the brooks that
fed it, and the trickling springs that fed the brooks.&nbsp; The
situation of Margery&rsquo;s house was visible, though not the
house itself; and the Baron gazed that way for an infinitely long
time, till, remembering himself, he moved on.</p>
<p>Instead of returning to the house he went along the ridge till
he arrived at the verge of Chillington Wood, and in the same
desultory manner roamed under the trees, not pausing till he had
come to Three-Walks-End, and the hollow elm hard by.&nbsp; He
peeped in at the rift.&nbsp; In the soft dry layer of touch-wood
that floored the hollow Margery&rsquo;s tracks were still
visible, as she had made them there when dressing for the
ball.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little Margery!&rsquo; murmured the Baron.</p>
<p>In a moment he thought better of this mood, and turned to go
home.&nbsp; But behold, a form stood behind him&mdash;that of the
girl whose name had been on his lips.</p>
<p>She was in utter confusion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;did
not know you were here, sir!&rsquo; she began.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was
out for a little walk.&rsquo;&nbsp; She could get no further; her
eyes filled with tears.&nbsp; That spice of wilfulness, even
hardness, which characterized her in Jim&rsquo;s company,
magically disappeared in the presence of the Baron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, never mind,&rsquo; said he, masking under a
severe manner whatever he felt.&nbsp; &lsquo;The meeting is
awkward, and ought not to have occurred, especially if as I
suppose, you are shortly to be married to James Hayward.&nbsp;
But it cannot be helped now.&nbsp; You had no idea I was here, of
course.&nbsp; Neither had I of seeing you.&nbsp; Remember you
cannot be too careful,&rsquo; continued the Baron, in the same
grave tone; &lsquo;and I strongly request you as a friend to do
your utmost to avoid meetings like this.&nbsp; When you saw me
before I turned, why did you not go away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not see you, sir.&nbsp; I did not think of seeing
you.&nbsp; I was walking this way, and I only looked in to see
the tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That shows you have been thinking of things you should
not think of,&rsquo; returned the Baron.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery could answer nothing.&nbsp; A browbeaten glance,
almost of misery, was all she gave him.&nbsp; He took a slow step
away from her; then turned suddenly back and, stooping,
impulsively kissed her cheek, taking her as much by surprise as
ever a woman was taken in her life.</p>
<p>Immediately after he went off with a flushed face and rapid
strides, which he did not check till he was within his own
boundaries.</p>
<p>The haymaking season now set in vigorously, and the
weir-hatches were all drawn in the meads to drain off the
water.&nbsp; The streams ran themselves dry, and there was no
longer any difficulty in walking about among them.&nbsp; The
Baron could very well witness from the elevations about his house
the activity which followed these preliminaries.&nbsp; The white
shirt-sleeves of the mowers glistened in the sun, the scythes
flashed, voices echoed, snatches of song floated about, and there
were glimpses of red waggon-wheels, purple gowns, and
many-coloured handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>The Baron had been told that the haymaking was to be followed
by the wedding, and had he gone down the vale to the dairy he
would have had evidence to that effect.&nbsp; Dairyman
Tucker&rsquo;s house was in a whirlpool of bustle, and among
other difficulties was that of turning the cheese-room into a
genteel apartment for the time being, and hiding the awkwardness
of having to pass through the milk-house to get to the parlour
door.&nbsp; These household contrivances appeared to interest
Margery much more than the great question of dressing for the
ceremony and the ceremony itself.&nbsp; In all relating to that
she showed an indescribable backwardness, which later on was well
remembered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it were only somebody else, and I was one of the
bridesmaids, I really think I should like it better!&rsquo; she
murmured one afternoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Away with thee&mdash;that&rsquo;s only your
shyness!&rsquo; said one of the milkmaids.</p>
<p>It is said that about this time the Baron seemed to feel the
effects of solitude strongly.&nbsp; Solitude revives the simple
instincts of primitive man, and lonely country nooks afford rich
soil for wayward emotions.&nbsp; Moreover, idleness waters those
unconsidered impulses which a short season of turmoil would stamp
out.&nbsp; It is difficult to speak with any exactness of the
bearing of such conditions on the mind of the Baron&mdash;a man
of whom so little was ever truly known&mdash;but there is no
doubt that his mind ran much on Margery as an individual, without
reference to her rank or quality, or to the question whether she
would marry Jim Hayward that summer.&nbsp; She was the single
lovely human thing within his present horizon, for he lived in
absolute seclusion; and her image unduly affected him.</p>
<p>But, leaving conjecture, let me state what happened.</p>
<p>One Saturday evening, two or three weeks after his accidental
meeting with her in the wood, he wrote the note
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear
Margery</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>You must not suppose that, because I spoke somewhat severely
to you at our chance encounter by the hollow tree, I have any
feeling against you.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; Now, as ever, I
have the most grateful sense of your considerate kindness to me
on a momentous occasion which shall be nameless.</p>
<p>You solemnly promised to come and see me whenever I should
send for you.&nbsp; Can you call for five minutes as soon as
possible, and disperse those plaguy glooms from which I am so
unfortunate as to suffer?&nbsp; If you refuse I will not answer
for the consequences.</p>
<p>I shall be in the summer shelter of the mount to-morrow
morning at half-past ten.&nbsp; If you come I shall be
grateful.&nbsp; I have also something for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours,<br />
X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In keeping with the tenor of this epistle the desponding,
self-oppressed Baron ascended the mount on Sunday morning and sat
down.&nbsp; There was nothing here to signify exactly the hour,
but before the church bells had begun he heard somebody
approaching at the back.&nbsp; The light footstep moved timidly,
first to one recess, and then to another; then to the third,
where he sat in the shade.&nbsp; Poor Margery stood before
him.</p>
<p>She looked worn and weary, and her little shoes and the skirts
of her dress were covered with dust.&nbsp; The weather was
sultry, the sun being already high and powerful, and rain had not
fallen for weeks.&nbsp; The Baron, who walked little, had thought
nothing of the effects of this heat and drought in inducing
fatigue.&nbsp; A distance which had been but a reasonable
exercise on a foggy morning was a drag for Margery now.&nbsp; She
was out of breath; and anxiety, even unhappiness was written on
her everywhere.</p>
<p>He rose to his feet, and took her hand.&nbsp; He was vexed
with himself at sight of her.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear little
girl!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are tired&mdash;you should
not have come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You sent for me, sir; and I was afraid you were ill;
and my promise to you was sacred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He bent over her, looking upon her downcast face, and still
holding her hand; then he dropped it, and took a pace or two
backwards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a whim, nothing more,&rsquo; he said,
sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wanted to see my little friend, to express
good wishes&mdash;and to present her with this.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
held forward a small morocco case, and showed her how to open it,
disclosing a pretty locket, set with pearls.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
intended as a wedding present,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;To be returned to me again if you do not marry Jim this
summer&mdash;it is to be this summer, I think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was, sir,&rsquo; she said with agitation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But it is so no longer.&nbsp; And, therefore, I cannot
take this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was to have been to-day; but now it cannot
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wedding to-day&mdash;Sunday?&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We fixed Sunday not to hinder much time at this busy
season of the year,&rsquo; replied she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have you, then, put it off&mdash;surely
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You sent for me, and I have come,&rsquo; she answered
humbly, like an obedient familiar in the employ of some great
enchanter.&nbsp; Indeed, the Baron&rsquo;s power over this
innocent girl was curiously like enchantment, or mesmeric
influence.&nbsp; It was so masterful that the sexual element was
almost eliminated.&nbsp; It was that of Prospero over the gentle
Ariel.&nbsp; And yet it was probably only that of the cosmopolite
over the recluse, of the experienced man over the simple
maid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have come&mdash;on your wedding-day!&mdash;O
Margery, this is a mistake.&nbsp; Of course, you should not have
obeyed me, since, though I thought your wedding would be soon, I
did not know it was to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promised you, sir; and I would rather keep my promise
to you than be married to Jim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That must not be&mdash;the feeling is wrong!&rsquo; he
murmured, looking at the distant hills.&nbsp; &lsquo;There seems
to be a fate in all this; I get out of the frying-pan into the
fire.&nbsp; What a recompense to you for your goodness!&nbsp; The
fact is, I was out of health and out of spirits, so I&mdash;but
no more of that.&nbsp; Now instantly to repair this tremendous
blunder that we have made&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, he went on hurriedly, &lsquo;Walk down the
hill; get into the road.&nbsp; By that time I shall be there with
a phaeton.&nbsp; We may get back in time.&nbsp; What time is it
now?&nbsp; If not, no doubt the wedding can be to-morrow; so all
will come right again.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t cry, my dear girl.&nbsp;
Keep the locket, of course&mdash;you&rsquo;ll marry
Jim.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>He hastened down towards the stables, and she went on as
directed.&nbsp; It seemed as if he must have put in the horse
himself, so quickly did he reappear with the phaeton on the open
road.&nbsp; Margery silently took her seat, and the Baron seemed
cut to the quick with self-reproach as he noticed the listless
indifference with which she acted.&nbsp; There was no doubt that
in her heart she had preferred obeying the apparently important
mandate that morning to becoming Jim&rsquo;s wife; but there was
no less doubt that had the Baron left her alone she would quietly
have gone to the altar.</p>
<p>He drove along furiously, in a cloud of dust.&nbsp; There was
much to contemplate in that peaceful Sunday morning&mdash;the
windless trees and fields, the shaking sunlight, the pause in
human stir.&nbsp; Yet neither of them heeded, and thus they drew
near to the dairy.&nbsp; His first expressed intention had been
to go indoors with her, but this he abandoned as impolitic in the
highest degree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may be soon enough,&rsquo; he said, springing down,
and helping her to follow.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell the truth: say you
were sent for to receive a wedding present&mdash;that it was a
mistake on my part&mdash;a mistake on yours; and I think
they&rsquo;ll forgive . . . And, Margery, my last request to you
is this: that if I send for you again, you do not come.&nbsp;
Promise solemnly, my dear girl, that any such request shall be
unheeded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her lips moved, but the promise was not articulated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O, sir, I cannot promise it!&rsquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you must; your salvation may depend on it!&rsquo;
he insisted almost sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know
what I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, sir, I promise,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now leave me to myself, please, and I&rsquo;ll go indoors
and manage matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned the horse and drove away, but only for a little
distance.&nbsp; Out of sight he pulled rein suddenly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Only to go back and propose it to her, and she&rsquo;d
come!&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>He stood up in the phaeton, and by this means he could see
over the hedge.&nbsp; Margery still sat listlessly in the same
place; there was not a lovelier flower in the field.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;no,
no&mdash;never!&rsquo;&nbsp; He reseated himself, and the wheels
sped lightly back over the soft dust to Mount Lodge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Margery had not moved.&nbsp; If the Baron could
dissimulate on the side of severity she could dissimulate on the
side of calm.&nbsp; He did not know what had been veiled by the
quiet promise to manage matters indoors.&nbsp; Rising at length
she first turned away from the house; and, by-and-by, having
apparently forgotten till then that she carried it in her hand,
she opened the case, and looked at the locket.&nbsp; This seemed
to give her courage.&nbsp; She turned, set her face towards the
dairy in good earnest, and though her heart faltered when the
gates came in sight, she kept on and drew near the door.</p>
<p>On the threshold she stood listening.&nbsp; The house was
silent.&nbsp; Decorations were visible in the passage, and also
the carefully swept and sanded path to the gate, which she was to
have trodden as a bride; but the sparrows hopped over it as if it
were abandoned; and all appeared to have been checked at its
climacteric, like a clock stopped on the strike.&nbsp; Till this
moment of confronting the suspended animation of the scene she
had not realized the full shock of the convulsion which her
disappearance must have caused.&nbsp; It is quite
certain&mdash;apart from her own repeated assurances to that
effect in later years&mdash;that in hastening off that morning to
her sudden engagement, Margery had not counted the cost of such
an enterprise; while a dim notion that she might get back again
in time for the ceremony, if the message meant nothing serious,
should also be mentioned in her favour.&nbsp; But, upon the
whole, she had obeyed the call with an unreasoning obedience
worthy of a disciple in primitive times.&nbsp; A conviction that
the Baron&rsquo;s life might depend upon her presence&mdash;for
she had by this time divined the tragical event she had
interrupted on the foggy morning&mdash;took from her all will to
judge and consider calmly.&nbsp; The simple affairs of her and
hers seemed nothing beside the possibility of harm to him.</p>
<p>A well-known step moved on the sanded floor within, and she
went forward.&nbsp; That she saw her father&rsquo;s face before
her, just within the door, can hardly be said: it was rather
Reproach and Rage in a human mask.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! ye have dared to come back alive, hussy, to look
upon the dupery you have practised on honest people!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve mortified us all; I don&rsquo;t want to see
&rsquo;ee; I don&rsquo;t want to hear &rsquo;ee; I don&rsquo;t
want to know anything!&rsquo;&nbsp; He walked up and down the
room, unable to command himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing but being
dead could have excused &rsquo;ee for not meeting and marrying
that man this morning; and yet you have the brazen impudence to
stand there as well as ever!&nbsp; What be you here
for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come back to marry Jim, if he wants me
to,&rsquo; she said faintly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if
not&mdash;perhaps so much the better.&nbsp; I was sent for this
morning early.&nbsp; I thought&mdash;.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
halted.&nbsp; To say that she had thought a man&rsquo;s death
might happen by his own hand if she did not go to him, would
never do.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was obliged to go,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had given my word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us then, so that the wedding
could be put off, without making fools o&rsquo; us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t let me go, and
I had made up my mind to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To go where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was silent; till she said, &lsquo;I will tell Jim all, and
why it was; and if he&rsquo;s any friend of mine he&rsquo;ll
excuse me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Jim&mdash;he&rsquo;s no such fool.&nbsp; Jim had
put all ready for you, Jim had called at your house, a-dressed up
in his new wedding clothes, and a-smiling like the sun; Jim had
told the parson, had got the ringers in tow, and the clerk
awaiting; and then&mdash;you was <i>gone</i>!&nbsp; Then Jim
turned as pale as rendlewood, and busted out, &ldquo;If she
don&rsquo;t marry me to-day,&rdquo; &rsquo;a said, &ldquo;she
don&rsquo;t marry me at all!&nbsp; No; let her look elsewhere for
a husband.&nbsp; For tew years I&rsquo;ve put up with her haughty
tricks and her takings,&rdquo; &rsquo;a said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve droudged and I&rsquo;ve traipsed, I&rsquo;ve
bought and I&rsquo;ve sold, all wi&rsquo; an eye to her;
I&rsquo;ve suffered horseflesh,&rdquo; he says&mdash;yes, them
was his noble words&mdash;&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll suffer it no
longer.&nbsp; She shall go!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; says
I, &ldquo;you be a man.&nbsp; If she&rsquo;s alive, I commend
&rsquo;ee; if she&rsquo;s dead, pity my old age.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;for
I&rsquo;ve just heard she was seen walking off across the fields
this morning, looking all of a scornful triumph.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
turned round and went, and the rest o&rsquo; the neighbours went;
and here be I left to the reproach o&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was too hasty,&rsquo; murmured Margery.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For now he&rsquo;s said this I can&rsquo;t marry him
to-morrow, as I might ha&rsquo; done; and perhaps so much the
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can be so calm about it, can ye?&nbsp; Be my
arrangements nothing, then, that you should break &rsquo;em up,
and say off hand what wasn&rsquo;t done to-day might ha&rsquo;
been done to-morrow, and such flick-flack?&nbsp; Out o&rsquo; my
sight!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t hear any more.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
speak to &rsquo;ee any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go away, and then you&rsquo;ll be
sorry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, go.&nbsp; Sorry&mdash;not I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned and stamped his way into the cheese-room.&nbsp;
Margery went upstairs.&nbsp; She too was excited now, and instead
of fortifying herself in her bedroom till her father&rsquo;s rage
had blown over, as she had often done on lesser occasions, she
packed up a bundle of articles, crept down again, and went out of
the house.&nbsp; She had a place of refuge in these cases of
necessity, and her father knew it, and was less alarmed at seeing
her depart than he might otherwise have been.&nbsp; This place
was Rook&rsquo;s Gate, the house of her grandmother, who always
took Margery&rsquo;s part when that young woman was particularly
in the wrong.</p>
<p>The devious way she pursued, to avoid the vicinity of Mount
Lodge, was tedious, and she was already weary.&nbsp; But the
cottage was a restful place to arrive at, for she was her own
mistress there&mdash;her grandmother never coming down
stairs&mdash;and Edy, the woman who lived with and attended her,
being a cipher except in muscle and voice.&nbsp; The approach was
by a straight open road, bordered by thin lank trees, all sloping
away from the south-west wind-quarter, and the scene bore a
strange resemblance to certain bits of Dutch landscape which have
been imprinted on the world&rsquo;s eye by Hobbema and his
school.</p>
<p>Having explained to her granny that the wedding was put off;
and that she had come to stay, one of Margery&rsquo;s first acts
was carefully to pack up the locket and case, her wedding present
from the Baron.&nbsp; The conditions of the gift were
unfulfilled, and she wished it to go back instantly.&nbsp;
Perhaps, in the intricacies of her bosom, there lurked a greater
satisfaction with the reason for returning the present than she
would have felt just then with a reason for keeping it.</p>
<p>To send the article was difficult.&nbsp; In the evening she
wrapped herself up, searched and found a gauze veil that had been
used by her grandmother in past years for hiving swarms of bees,
buried her face in it, and sallied forth with a palpitating heart
till she drew near the tabernacle of her demi-god the
Baron.&nbsp; She ventured only to the back-door, where she handed
in the parcel addressed to him, and quickly came away.</p>
<p>Now it seems that during the day the Baron had been unable to
learn the result of his attempt to return Margery in time for the
event he had interrupted.&nbsp; Wishing, for obvious reasons, to
avoid direct inquiry by messenger, and being too unwell to go far
himself, he could learn no particulars.&nbsp; He was sitting in
thought after a lonely dinner when the parcel intimating failure
as brought in.&nbsp; The footman, whose curiosity had been
excited by the mode of its arrival, peeped through the keyhole
after closing the door, to learn what the packet meant.&nbsp;
Directly the Baron had opened it he thrust out his feet
vehemently from his chair, and began cursing his ruinous conduct
in bringing about such a disaster, for the return of the locket
denoted not only no wedding that day, but none to-morrow, or at
any time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have done that innocent woman a great wrong!&rsquo;
he murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Deprived her of, perhaps, her only
opportunity of becoming mistress of a happy home!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>A considerable period of inaction followed among all
concerned.</p>
<p>Nothing tended to dissipate the obscurity which veiled the
life of the Baron.&nbsp; The position he occupied in the minds of
the country-folk around was one which combined the mysteriousness
of a legendary character with the unobtrusive deeds of a modern
gentleman.&nbsp; To this day whoever takes the trouble to go down
to Silverthorn in Lower Wessex and make inquiries will find
existing there almost a superstitious feeling for the moody
melancholy stranger who resided in the Lodge some forty years
ago.</p>
<p>Whence he came, whither he was going, were alike
unknown.&nbsp; It was said that his mother had been an English
lady of noble family who had married a foreigner not unheard of
in circles where men pile up &lsquo;the cankered heaps of
strange-achieved gold&rsquo;&mdash;that he had been born and
educated in England, taken abroad, and so on.&nbsp; But the facts
of a life in such cases are of little account beside the aspect
of a life; and hence, though doubtless the years of his existence
contained their share of trite and homely circumstance, the
curtain which masked all this was never lifted to gratify such a
theatre of spectators as those at Silverthorn.&nbsp; Therein lay
his charm.&nbsp; His life was a vignette, of which the central
strokes only were drawn with any distinctness, the environment
shading away to a blank.</p>
<p>He might have been said to resemble that solitary bird the
heron.&nbsp; The still, lonely stream was his frequent haunt: on
its banks he would stand for hours with his rod, looking into the
water, beholding the tawny inhabitants with the eye of a
philosopher, and seeming to say, &lsquo;Bite or don&rsquo;t
bite&mdash;it&rsquo;s all the same to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was
often mistaken for a ghost by children; and for a pollard willow
by men, when, on their way home in the dusk, they saw him
motionless by some rushy bank, unobservant of the decline of
day.</p>
<p>Why did he come to fish near Silverthorn?&nbsp; That was never
explained.&nbsp; As far as was known he had no relatives near;
the fishing there was not exceptionally good; the society
thereabout was decidedly meagre.&nbsp; That he had committed some
folly or hasty act, that he had been wrongfully accused of some
crime, thus rendering his seclusion from the world desirable for
a while, squared very well with his frequent melancholy.&nbsp;
But such as he was there he lived, well supplied with
fishing-tackle, and tenant of a furnished house, just suited to
the requirements of such an eccentric being as he.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Margery&rsquo;s father, having privately ascertained that she
was living with her grandmother, and getting into no harm,
refrained from communicating with her, in the hope of seeing her
contrite at his door.&nbsp; It had, of course, become known about
Silverthorn that at the last moment Margery refused to wed
Hayward, by absenting herself from the house.&nbsp; Jim was
pitied, yet not pitied much, for it was said that he ought not to
have been so eager for a woman who had shown no anxiety for
him.</p>
<p>And where was Jim himself?&nbsp; It must not be supposed that
that tactician had all this while withdrawn from mortal eye to
tear his hair in silent indignation and despair.&nbsp; He had, in
truth, merely retired up the lonesome defile between the downs to
his smouldering kiln, and the ancient ramparts above it; and
there, after his first hours of natural discomposure, he quietly
waited for overtures from the possibly repentant Margery.&nbsp;
But no overtures arrived, and then he meditated anew on the
absorbing problem of her skittishness, and how to set about
another campaign for her conquest, notwithstanding his late
disastrous failure.&nbsp; Why had he failed?&nbsp; To what was
her strange conduct owing?&nbsp; That was the thing which puzzled
him.</p>
<p>He had made no advance in solving the riddle when, one
morning, a stranger appeared on the down above him, looking as if
he had lost his way.&nbsp; The man had a good deal of black hair
below his felt hat, and carried under his arm a case containing a
musical instrument.&nbsp; Descending to where Jim stood, he asked
if there were not a short cut across that way to Tivworthy, where
a f&ecirc;te was to be held.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes, there is,&rsquo; said Jim.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
&rsquo;tis an enormous distance for &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; replied the musician.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wish to intercept the carrier on the highway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The nearest way was precisely in the direction of Rook&rsquo;s
Gate, where Margery, as Jim knew, was staying.&nbsp; Having some
time to spare, Jim was strongly impelled to make a kind act to
the lost musician a pretext for taking observations in that
neighbourhood, and telling his acquaintance that he was going the
same way, he started without further ado.</p>
<p>They skirted the long length of meads, and in due time arrived
at the back of Rook&rsquo;s Gate, where the path joined the high
road.&nbsp; A hedge divided the public way from the cottage
garden.&nbsp; Jim drew up at this point and said, &lsquo;Your
road is straight on: I turn back here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the musician was standing fixed, as if in great
perplexity.&nbsp; Thrusting his hand into his forest of black
hair, he murmured, &lsquo;Surely it is the
same&mdash;surely!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim, following the direction of his neighbour&rsquo;s eyes,
found them to be fixed on a figure till that moment hidden from
himself&mdash;Margery Tucker&mdash;who was crossing the garden to
an opposite gate with a little cheese in her arms, her head
thrown back, and her face quite exposed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What of her?&rsquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two months ago I formed one of the band at the Yeomanry
Ball given by Lord Toneborough in the next county.&nbsp; I saw
that young lady dancing the polka there in robes of gauze and
lace.&nbsp; Now I see her carry a cheese!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said Jim incredulously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I do not mistake.&nbsp; I say it is so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim ridiculed the idea; the bandsman protested, and was about
to lose his temper, when Jim gave in with the good-nature of a
person who can afford to despise opinions; and the musician went
his way.</p>
<p>As he dwindled out of sight Jim began to think more carefully
over what he had said.&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s thoughts grew
quite to an excitement, for there came into his mind the
Baron&rsquo;s extraordinary kindness in regard to furniture,
hitherto accounted for by the assumption that the nobleman had
taken a fancy to him.&nbsp; Could it be, among all the amazing
things of life, that the Baron was at the bottom of this
mischief; and that he had amused himself by taking Margery to a
ball?</p>
<p>Doubts and suspicions which distract some lovers to imbecility
only served to bring out Jim&rsquo;s great qualities.&nbsp; Where
he trusted he was the most trusting fellow in the world; where he
doubted he could be guilty of the slyest strategy.&nbsp; Once
suspicious, he became one of those subtle, watchful characters
who, without integrity, make good thieves; with a little, good
jobbers; with a little more, good diplomatists.&nbsp; Jim was
honest, and he considered what to do.</p>
<p>Retracing his steps, he peeped again.&nbsp; She had gone in;
but she would soon reappear, for it could be seen that she was
carrying little new cheeses one by one to a spring-cart and horse
tethered outside the gate&mdash;her grandmother, though not a
regular dairywoman, still managing a few cows by means of a man
and maid.&nbsp; With the lightness of a cat Jim crept round to
the gate, took a piece of chalk from his pocket, and wrote upon
the boarding &lsquo;The Baron.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he retreated to
the other side of the garden where he had just watched
Margery.</p>
<p>In due time she emerged with another little cheese, came on to
the garden-door, and glanced upon the chalked words which
confronted her.&nbsp; She started; the cheese rolled from her
arms to the ground, and broke into pieces like a pudding.</p>
<p>She looked fearfully round, her face burning like sunset, and,
seeing nobody, stooped to pick up the flaccid lumps.&nbsp; Jim,
with a pale face, departed as invisibly as he had come.&nbsp; He
had proved the bandsman&rsquo;s tale to be true.&nbsp; On his way
back he formed a resolution.&nbsp; It was to beard the lion in
his den&mdash;to call on the Baron.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Margery had recovered her equanimity, and gathered
up the broken cheese.&nbsp; But she could by no means account for
the handwriting.&nbsp; Jim was just the sort of fellow to play
her such a trick at ordinary times, but she imagined him to be
far too incensed against her to do it now; and she suddenly
wondered if it were any sort of signal from the Baron
himself.</p>
<p>Of him she had lately heard nothing.&nbsp; If ever monotony
pervaded a life it pervaded hers at Rook&rsquo;s Gate; and she
had begun to despair of any happy change.&nbsp; But it is
precisely when the social atmosphere seems stagnant that great
events are brewing.&nbsp; Margery&rsquo;s quiet was broken first,
as we have seen, by a slight start, only sufficient to make her
drop a cheese; and then by a more serious matter.</p>
<p>She was inside the same garden one day when she heard two
watermen talking without.&nbsp; The conversation was to the
effect that the strange gentleman who had taken Mount Lodge for
the season was seriously ill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How ill?&rsquo; cried Margery through the hedge, which
screened her from recognition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad abed,&rsquo; said one of the watermen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Inflammation of the lungs,&rsquo; said the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Got wet, fishing,&rsquo; the first chimed in.</p>
<p>Margery could gather no more.&nbsp; An ideal admiration rather
than any positive passion existed in her breast for the Baron:
she had of late seen too little of him to allow any incipient
views of him as a lover to grow to formidable dimensions.&nbsp;
It was an extremely romantic feeling, delicate as an aroma,
capable of quickening to an active principle, or dying to
&lsquo;a painless sympathy,&rsquo; as the case might be.</p>
<p>This news of his illness, coupled with the mysterious chalking
on the gate, troubled her, and revived his image much.&nbsp; She
took to walking up and down the garden-paths, looking into the
hearts of flowers, and not thinking what they were.&nbsp; His
last request had been that she was not to go to him if be should
send for her; and now she asked herself, was the name on the gate
a hint to enable her to go without infringing the letter of her
promise?&nbsp; Thus unexpectedly had Jim&rsquo;s man&oelig;uvre
operated.</p>
<p>Ten days passed.&nbsp; All she could hear of the Baron were
the same words, &lsquo;Bad abed,&rsquo; till one afternoon, after
a gallop of the physician to the Lodge, the tidings spread like
lightning that the Baron was dying.</p>
<p>Margery distressed herself with the question whether she might
be permitted to visit him and say her prayers at his bedside; but
she feared to venture; and thus eight-and-forty hours slipped
away, and the Baron still lived.&nbsp; Despite her shyness and
awe of him she had almost made up her mind to call when, just at
dusk on that October evening, somebody came to the door and asked
for her.</p>
<p>She could see the messenger&rsquo;s head against the low new
moon.&nbsp; He was a man-servant.&nbsp; He said he had been all
the way to her father&rsquo;s, and had been sent thence to her
here.&nbsp; He simply brought a note, and, delivering it into her
hands, went away.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Margery Tucker</span>
(ran the note)&mdash;They say I am not likely to live, so I want
to see you.&nbsp; Be here at eight o&rsquo;clock this
evening.&nbsp; Come quite alone to the side-door, and tap four
times softly.&nbsp; My trusty man will admit you.&nbsp; The
occasion is an important one.&nbsp; Prepare yourself for a solemn
ceremony, which I wish to have performed while it lies in my
power.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Von
Xanten</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>Margery&rsquo;s face flushed up, and her neck and arms glowed
in sympathy.&nbsp; The quickness of youthful imagination, and the
assumptiveness of woman&rsquo;s reason, sent her straight as an
arrow this thought: &lsquo;He wants to marry me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had heard of similar strange proceedings, in which the
orange-flower and the sad cypress were intertwined.&nbsp; People
sometimes wished on their death-beds, from motives of esteem, to
form a legal tie which they had not cared to establish as a
domestic one during their active life.</p>
<p>For a few minutes Margery could hardly be called excited; she
was excitement itself.&nbsp; Between surprise and modesty she
blushed and trembled by turns.&nbsp; She became grave, sat down
in the solitary room, and looked into the fire.&nbsp; At seven
o&rsquo;clock she rose resolved, and went quite tranquilly
upstairs, where she speedily began to dress.</p>
<p>In making this hasty toilet nine-tenths of her care were given
to her hands.&nbsp; The summer had left them slightly brown, and
she held them up and looked at them with some misgiving, the
fourth finger of her left hand more especially.&nbsp; Hot
washings and cold washings, certain products from bee and flower
known only to country girls, everything she could think of, were
used upon those little sunburnt hands, till she persuaded herself
that they were really as white as could be wished by a husband
with a hundred titles.&nbsp; Her dressing completed, she left
word with Edy that she was going for a long walk, and set out in
the direction of Mount Lodge.</p>
<p>She no longer tripped like a girl, but walked like a
woman.&nbsp; While crossing the park she murmured &lsquo;Baroness
von Xanten&rsquo; in a pronunciation of her own.&nbsp; The sound
of that title caused her such agitation that she was obliged to
pause, with her hand upon her heart.</p>
<p>The house was so closely neighboured by shrubberies on three
of its sides that it was not till she had gone nearly round it
that she found the little door.&nbsp; The resolution she had been
an hour in forming failed her when she stood at the portal.&nbsp;
While pausing for courage to tap, a carriage drove up to the
front entrance a little way off, and peeping round the corner she
saw alight a clergyman, and a gentleman in whom Margery fancied
that she recognized a well-known solicitor from the neighbouring
town.&nbsp; She had no longer any doubt of the nature of the
ceremony proposed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is sudden but I must obey
him!&rsquo; she murmured: and tapped four times.</p>
<p>The door was opened so quickly that the servant must have been
standing immediately inside.&nbsp; She thought him the man who
had driven them to the ball&mdash;the silent man who could be
trusted.&nbsp; Without a word he conducted her up the back
staircase, and through a door at the top, into a wide
corridor.&nbsp; She was asked to wait in a little dressing-room,
where there was a fire, and an old metal-framed looking-glass
over the mantel-piece, in which she caught sight of
herself.&nbsp; A red spot burnt in each of her cheeks; the rest
of her face was pale; and her eyes were like diamonds of the
first water.</p>
<p>Before she had been seated many minutes the man came back
noiselessly, and she followed him to a door covered by a red and
black curtain, which he lifted, and ushered her into a large
chamber.&nbsp; A screened light stood on a table before her, and
on her left the hangings of a tall dark four-post bedstead
obstructed her view of the centre of the room.&nbsp; Everything
here seemed of such a magnificent type to her eyes that she felt
confused, diminished to half her height, half her strength, half
her prettiness.&nbsp; The man who had conducted her retired at
once, and some one came softly round the angle of the
bed-curtains.&nbsp; He held out his hand kindly&mdash;rather
patronisingly: it was the solicitor whom she knew by sight.&nbsp;
This gentleman led her forward, as if she had been a lamb rather
than a woman, till the occupant of the bed was revealed.</p>
<p>The Baron&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and her entry had been so
noiseless that he did not open them.&nbsp; The pallor of his face
nearly matched the white bed-linen, and his dark hair and heavy
black moustache were like dashes of ink on a clean page.&nbsp;
Near him sat the parson and another gentleman, whom she
afterwards learnt to be a London physician; and on the parson
whispering a few words the Baron opened his eyes.&nbsp; As soon
as he saw her he smiled faintly, and held out his hand.</p>
<p>Margery would have wept for him, if she had not been too
overawed and palpitating to do anything.&nbsp; She quite forgot
what she had come for, shook hands with him mechanically, and
could hardly return an answer to his weak &lsquo;Dear Margery,
you see how I am&mdash;how are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In preparing for marriage she had not calculated on such a
scene as this.&nbsp; Her affection for the Baron had too much of
the vague in it to afford her trustfulness now.&nbsp; She wished
she had not come.&nbsp; On a sign from the Baron the lawyer
brought her a chair, and the oppressive silence was broken by the
Baron&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am pulled down to death&rsquo;s door, Margery,&rsquo;
he said; &lsquo;and I suppose I soon shall pass through . . . My
peace has been much disturbed in this illness, for just before it
attacked me I received&mdash;that present you returned, from
which, and in other ways, I learnt that you had lost your chance
of marriage . . . Now it was I who did the harm, and you can
imagine how the news has affected me.&nbsp; It has worried me all
the illness through, and I cannot dismiss my error from my mind .
. . I want to right the wrong I have done you before I die.&nbsp;
Margery, you have always obeyed me, and, strange as the request
may be, will you obey me now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She whispered &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said the Baron, &lsquo;these three
gentlemen are here for a special purpose: one helps the
body&mdash;he&rsquo;s called a physician; another helps the
soul&mdash;he&rsquo;s a parson; the other helps the
understanding&mdash;he&rsquo;s a lawyer.&nbsp; They are here
partly on my account, and partly on yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The speaker then made a sign to the lawyer, who went out of
the door.&nbsp; He came back almost instantly, but not
alone.&nbsp; Behind him, dressed up in his best clothes, with a
flower in his buttonhole and a bridegroom&rsquo;s air,
walked&mdash;Jim.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>Margery could hardly repress a scream.&nbsp; As for flushing
and blushing, she had turned hot and turned pale so many times
already during the evening, that there was really now nothing of
that sort left for her to do; and she remained in complexion much
as before.&nbsp; O, the mockery of it!&nbsp; That secret
dream&mdash;that sweet word &lsquo;Baroness!&rsquo;&mdash;which
had sustained her all the way along.&nbsp; Instead of a Baron
there stood Jim, white-waistcoated, demure, every hair in place,
and, if she mistook not, even a deedy spark in his eye.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s surprising presence on the scene may be briefly
accounted for.&nbsp; His resolve to seek an explanation with the
Baron at all risks had proved unexpectedly easy: the interview
had at once been granted, and then, seeing the crisis at which
matters stood, the Baron had generously revealed to Jim the whole
of his indebtedness to and knowledge of Margery.&nbsp; The truth
of the Baron&rsquo;s statement, the innocent nature as yet of the
acquaintanceship, his sorrow for the rupture he had produced, was
so evident that, far from having any further doubts of his
patron, Jim frankly asked his advice on the next step to be
pursued.&nbsp; At this stage the Baron fell ill, and, desiring
much to see the two young people united before his death, he had
sent anew Hayward, and proposed the plan which they were to now
about to attempt&mdash;a marriage at the bedside of the sick man
by special licence.&nbsp; The influence at Lambeth of some
friends of the Baron&rsquo;s, and the charitable bequests of his
late mother to several deserving Church funds, were generally
supposed to be among the reasons why the application for the
licence was not refused.</p>
<p>This, however, is of small consequence.&nbsp; The Baron
probably knew, in proposing this method of celebrating the
marriage, that his enormous power over her would outweigh any
sentimental obstacles which she might set up&mdash;inward
objections that, without his presence and firmness, might prove
too much for her acquiescence.&nbsp; Doubtless he foresaw, too,
the advantage of getting her into the house before making the
individuality of her husband clear to her mind.</p>
<p>Now, the Baron&rsquo;s conjectures were right as to the event,
but wrong as to the motives.&nbsp; Margery was a perfect little
dissembler on some occasions, and one of them was when she wished
to hide any sudden mortification that might bring her into
ridicule.&nbsp; She had no sooner recovered from her first fit of
discomfiture than pride bade her suffer anything rather than
reveal her absurd disappointment.&nbsp; Hence the scene
progressed as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come here, Hayward,&rsquo; said the invalid.&nbsp;
Hayward came near.&nbsp; The Baron, holding her hand in one of
his own, and her lover&rsquo;s in the other, continued,
&lsquo;Will you, in spite of your recent vexation with her, marry
her now if she does not refuse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, sir,&rsquo; said Jim promptly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Margery, what do you say?&nbsp; It is merely a
setting of things right.&nbsp; You have already promised this
young man to be his wife, and should, of course, perform your
promise.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t dislike Jim?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, no, sir,&rsquo; she said, in a low, dry voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like him better than I can tell you,&rsquo; said the
Baron.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is an honourable man, and will make you a
good husband.&nbsp; You must remember that marriage is a life
contract, in which general compatibility of temper and worldly
position is of more importance than fleeting passion, which never
long survives.&nbsp; Now, will you, at my earnest request, and
before I go to the South of Europe to die, agree to make this
good man happy?&nbsp; I have expressed your views on the subject,
haven&rsquo;t I, Hayward?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To a T, sir,&rsquo; said Jim emphatically; with a
motion of raising his hat to his influential ally, till he
remembered he had no hat on.&nbsp; &lsquo;And, though I could
hardly expect Margery to gie in for my asking, I feels she ought
to gie in for yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you accept him, my little friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;if he&rsquo;ll
agree to a thing or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doubtless he will&mdash;what are they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I shall not be made to live with him till I am in
the mind for it; and that my having him shall be kept unknown for
the present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what do you think of it, Hayward?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything that you or she may wish I&rsquo;ll do, my
noble lord,&rsquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, her request is not unreasonable, seeing that the
proceedings are, on my account, a little hurried.&nbsp; So
we&rsquo;ll proceed.&nbsp; You rather expected this, from my
allusion to a ceremony in my note, did you not,
Margery?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said she, with an effort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good; I thought so; you looked so little
surprised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We now leave the scene in the bedroom for a spot not many
yards off.</p>
<p>When the carriage seen by Margery at the door was driving up
to Mount Lodge it arrested the attention, not only of the young
girl, but of a man who had for some time been moving slowly about
the opposite lawn, engaged in some operation while he smoked a
short pipe.&nbsp; A short observation of his doings would have
shown that he was sheltering some delicate plants from an
expected frost, and that he was the gardener.&nbsp; When the
light at the door fell upon the entering forms of parson and
lawyer&mdash;the former a stranger, the latter known to
him&mdash;the gardener walked thoughtfully round the house.&nbsp;
Reaching the small side-entrance he was further surprised to see
it noiselessly open to a young woman, in whose momentarily
illumined features he discerned those of Margery Tucker.</p>
<p>Altogether there was something curious in this.&nbsp; The man
returned to the lawn front, and perfunctorily went on putting
shelters over certain plants, though his thoughts were plainly
otherwise engaged.&nbsp; On the grass his footsteps were
noiseless, and the night moreover being still, he could presently
hear a murmuring from the bedroom window over his head.</p>
<p>The gardener took from a tree a ladder that he had used in
nailing that day, set it under the window, and ascended half-way,
hoodwinking his conscience by seizing a nail or two with his hand
and testing their twig-supporting powers.&nbsp; He soon heard
enough to satisfy him.&nbsp; The words of a church-service in the
strange parson&rsquo;s voice were audible in snatches through the
blind: they were words he knew to be part of the solemnization of
matrimony, such as &lsquo;wedded wife,&rsquo; &lsquo;richer for
poorer,&rsquo; and so on; the less familiar parts being a more or
less confused sound.</p>
<p>Satisfied that a wedding was in progress there, the gardener
did not for a moment dream that one of the contracting parties
could be other than the sick Baron.&nbsp; He descended the ladder
and again walked round the house, waiting only till he saw
Margery emerge from the same little door; when, fearing that he
might be discovered, he withdrew in the direction of his own
cottage.</p>
<p>This building stood at the lower corner of the garden, and as
soon as the gardener entered he was accosted by a handsome woman
in a widow&rsquo;s cap, who called him father, and said that
supper had been ready for a long time.&nbsp; They sat down, but
during the meal the gardener was so abstracted and silent that
his daughter put her head winningly to one side and said,
&lsquo;What is it, father dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;what is it!&rsquo; cried the gardener.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Something that makes very little difference to me, but may
be of great account to you, if you play your cards well.&nbsp;
<i>There&rsquo;s been a wedding at the Lodge
to-night</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; He related to her, with a caution to
secrecy, all that he had heard and seen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are folk that have got to get their living,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;and such ones mustn&rsquo;t tell tales about
their betters,&mdash;Lord forgive the mockery of the
word!&mdash;but there&rsquo;s something to be made of it.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a nice maid; so, Harriet, do you take the first
chance you get for honouring her, before others know what has
happened.&nbsp; Since this is done so privately it will be kept
private for some time&mdash;till after his death, no
question;&mdash;when I expect she&rsquo;ll take this house for
herself; and blaze out as a widow-lady ten thousand pound
strong.&nbsp; You being a widow, she may make you her
company-keeper; and so you&rsquo;ll have a home by a little
contriving.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While this conversation progressed at the gardener&rsquo;s
Margery was on her way out of the Baron&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; She
was, indeed, married.&nbsp; But, as we know, she was not married
to the Baron.&nbsp; The ceremony over she seemed but little
discomposed, and expressed a wish to return alone as she had
come.&nbsp; To this, of course, no objection could be offered
under the terms of the agreement, and wishing Jim a frigid
good-bye, and the Baron a very quiet farewell, she went out by
the door which had admitted her.&nbsp; Once safe and alone in the
darkness of the park she burst into tears, which dropped upon the
grass as she passed along.&nbsp; In the Baron&rsquo;s room she
had seemed scared and helpless; now her reason and emotions
returned.&nbsp; The further she got away from the glamour of that
room, and the influence of its occupant, the more she became of
opinion that she had acted foolishly.&nbsp; She had disobediently
left her father&rsquo;s house, to obey him here.&nbsp; She had
pleased everybody but herself.</p>
<p>However, thinking was now too late.&nbsp; How she got into her
grandmother&rsquo;s house she hardly knew; but without a supper,
and without confronting either her relative or Edy, she went to
bed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>On going out into the garden next morning, with a strange
sense of being another person than herself, she beheld Jim
leaning mutely over the gate.</p>
<p>He nodded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good morning, Margery,&rsquo; he said
civilly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning,&rsquo; said Margery in the same tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But which way was you going this morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not going anywhere just now, thank you.&nbsp; But
I shall go to my father&rsquo;s by-and-by with Edy.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She went on with a sigh, &lsquo;I have done what he has all along
wished, that is, married you; and there&rsquo;s no longer reason
for enmity atween him and me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trew&mdash;trew.&nbsp; Well, as I am going the same
way, I can give you a lift in the trap, for the distance is
long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No thank you&mdash;I am used to walking,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>They remained in silence, the gate between them, till
Jim&rsquo;s convictions would apparently allow him to hold his
peace no longer.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a bad job!&rsquo; he
murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; she said, as one whose thoughts have only
too readily been identified.&nbsp; &lsquo;How I came to agree to
it is more than I can tell!&rsquo;&nbsp; And tears began rolling
down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The blame is more mine than yours, I suppose,&rsquo; he
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ought to have said No, and not backed up
the gentleman in carrying out this scheme.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas his
own notion entirely, as perhaps you know.&nbsp; I should never
have thought of such a plan; but he said you&rsquo;d be willing,
and that it would be all right; and I was too ready to believe
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The thing is, how to remedy it,&rsquo; said she
bitterly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe, of course, in your promise to
keep this private, and not to trouble me by calling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Jim.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to trouble you.&nbsp; As for that, why, my dear Mrs.
Hayward&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Mrs. Hayward me!&rsquo; said Margery
sharply.&nbsp; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be Mrs. Hayward!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, you are she by law, and that
was all I meant,&rsquo; he said mildly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said I would acknowledge no such thing, and I
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; A thing can&rsquo;t be legal when it&rsquo;s
against the wishes of the persons the laws are made to
protect.&nbsp; So I beg you not to call me that
anymore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Miss Tucker,&rsquo; said Jim
deferentially.&nbsp; &lsquo;We can live on exactly as
before.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t marry anybody else, that&rsquo;s
true; but beyond that there&rsquo;s no difference, and no harm
done.&nbsp; Your father ought to be told, I suppose, even if
nobody else is?&nbsp; It will partly reconcile him to you, and
make your life smoother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead of directly replying, Margery exclaimed in a low
voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it is a mistake&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t see it all,
owing to not having time to reflect!&nbsp; I agreed, thinking
that at least I should get reconciled to father by the
step.&nbsp; But perhaps he would as soon have me not married at
all as married and parted.&nbsp; I must ha&rsquo; been
enchanted&mdash;bewitched&mdash;when I gave my consent to
this!&nbsp; I only did it to please that dear good dying
nobleman&mdash;though why he should have wished it so much I
can&rsquo;t tell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I neither,&rsquo; said Jim.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,
we&rsquo;ve been fooled into it, Margery,&rsquo; he said, with
extraordinary gravity.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s had his way
wi&rsquo; us, and now we&rsquo;ve got to suffer for it.&nbsp;
Being a gentleman of patronage, and having bought several loads
of lime o&rsquo; me, and having given me all that splendid
furniture, I could hardly refuse&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, did he give you that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay sure&mdash;to help me win ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery covered her face with her hands; whereupon Jim stood
up from the gate and looked critically at her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a footy plot between you two men to&mdash;snare
me!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should you have done
it&mdash;why should he have done it&mdash;when I&rsquo;ve not
deserved to be treated so.&nbsp; He bought the
furniture&mdash;did he!&nbsp; O, I&rsquo;ve been taken
in&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been wronged!&rsquo;&nbsp; The grief and
vexation of finding that long ago, when fondly believing the
Baron to have lover-like feelings himself for her, he was still
conspiring to favour Jim&rsquo;s suit, was more than she could
endure.</p>
<p>Jim with distant courtesy waited, nibbling a straw, till her
paroxysm was over.&nbsp; &lsquo;One word, Miss
Tuck&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;Margery,&rsquo; he then recommenced
gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find me man enough to respect
your wish, and to leave you to yourself&mdash;for ever and ever,
if that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve just one word of advice
to render &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; That is, that before you go to
Silverthorn Dairy yourself you let me drive ahead and call on
your father.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s friends with me, and he&rsquo;s not
friends with you.&nbsp; I can break the news, a little at a time,
and I think I can gain his good will for you now, even though the
wedding be no natural wedding at all.&nbsp; At any count, I can
hear what he&rsquo;s got to say about &rsquo;ee, and come back
here and tell &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She nodded a cool assent to this, and he left her strolling
about the garden in the sunlight while he went on to reconnoitre
as agreed.&nbsp; It must not be supposed that Jim&rsquo;s dutiful
echoes of Margery&rsquo;s regret at her precipitate marriage were
all gospel; and there is no doubt that his private intention,
after telling the dairy-farmer what had happened, was to ask his
temporary assent to her caprice, till, in the course of time, she
should be reasoned out of her whims and induced to settle down
with Jim in a natural manner.&nbsp; He had, it is true, been
somewhat nettled by her firm objection to him, and her keen
sorrow for what she had done to please another; but he hoped for
the best.</p>
<p>But, alas for the astute Jim&rsquo;s calculations!&nbsp; He
drove on to the dairy, whose white walls now gleamed in the
morning sun; made fast the horse to a ring in the wall, and
entered the barton.&nbsp; Before knocking, he perceived the
dairyman walking across from a gate in the other direction, as if
he had just come in.&nbsp; Jim went over to him.&nbsp; Since the
unfortunate incident on the morning of the intended wedding they
had merely been on nodding terms, from a sense of awkwardness in
their relations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;is that thee?&rsquo; said Dairyman Tucker,
in a voice which unmistakably startled Jim by its abrupt
fierceness.&nbsp; &lsquo;A pretty fellow thou
be&rsquo;st!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a bad beginning for the young man&rsquo;s life as a
son-in-law, and augured ill for the delicate consultation he
desired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Matter!&nbsp; I wish some folks would burn their lime
without burning other folks&rsquo; property along wi&rsquo;
it.&nbsp; You ought to be ashamed of yourself.&nbsp; You call
yourself a man, Jim Hayward, and an honest lime-burner, and a
respectable, market-keeping Christen, and yet at six
o&rsquo;clock this morning, instead o&rsquo; being where you
ought to ha&rsquo; been&mdash;at your work, there was neither
vell or mark o&rsquo; thee to be seen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, I don&rsquo;t know what you are raving
at,&rsquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;the sparks from thy couch-heap blew over upon
my hay-rick, and the rick&rsquo;s burnt to ashes; and all to come
out o&rsquo; my well-squeezed pocket.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell thee
what it is, young man.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no business in
thee.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known Silverthorn folk, quick and dead,
for the last couple-o&rsquo;-score year, and I&rsquo;ve never
knew one so three-cunning for harm as thee, my gentleman
lime-burner; and I reckon it one o&rsquo; the luckiest days
o&rsquo; my life when I &rsquo;scaped having thee in my
family.&nbsp; That maid of mine was right; I was wrong.&nbsp; She
seed thee to be a drawlacheting rogue, and &rsquo;twas her wisdom
to go off that morning and get rid o&rsquo; thee.&nbsp; I commend
her for&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m going to fetch her home
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t take the trouble.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
coming home-along to-night of her own accord.&nbsp; I have seen
her this morning, and she told me so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the better.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll welcome her
warm.&nbsp; Nation!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner see her married to the
parish fool than thee.&nbsp; Not you&mdash;you don&rsquo;t care
for my hay.&nbsp; Tarrying about where you shouldn&rsquo;t be, in
bed, no doubt; that&rsquo;s what you was a-doing.&nbsp; Now,
don&rsquo;t you darken my doors again, and the sooner you be off
my bit o&rsquo; ground the better I shall be pleased.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked, as he felt, stultified.&nbsp; If the rick had been
really destroyed, a little blame certainly attached to him, but
he could not understand how it had happened.&nbsp; However, blame
or none, it was clear he could not, with any self-respect,
declare himself to be this peppery old gaffer&rsquo;s son-in-law
in the face of such an attack as this.</p>
<p>For months&mdash;almost years&mdash;the one transaction that
had seemed necessary to compose these two families satisfactorily
was Jim&rsquo;s union with Margery.&nbsp; No sooner had it been
completed than it appeared on all sides as the gravest mishap for
both.&nbsp; Stating coldly that he would discover how much of the
accident was to be attributed to his negligence, and pay the
damage, he went out of the barton, and returned the way he had
come.</p>
<p>Margery had been keeping a look-out for him, particularly
wishing him not to enter the house, lest others should see the
seriousness of their interview; and as soon as she heard wheels
she went to the gate, which was out of view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely father has been speaking roughly to you!&rsquo;
she said, on seeing his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the least doubt that he have,&rsquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is he still angry with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the least.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s waiting to welcome
&rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! because I&rsquo;ve married you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he thinks you have not married me!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s jawed me up hill and down.&nbsp; He hates me; and for
your sake I have not explained a word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery looked towards home with a sad, severe gaze.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mr. Hayward,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;we have made a great
mistake, and we are in a strange position.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what, mistress&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t stand&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He stopped suddenly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, well; I&rsquo;ve promised!&rsquo; he quietly
added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must suffer for our mistake,&rsquo; she went
on.&nbsp; &lsquo;The way to suffer least is to keep our own
counsel on what happened last evening, and not to meet.&nbsp; I
must now return to my father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He inclined his head in indifferent assent, and she went
indoors, leaving him there.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>Margery returned home, as she had decided, and resumed her old
life at Silverthorn.&nbsp; And seeing her father&rsquo;s
animosity towards Jim, she told him not a word of the
marriage.</p>
<p>Her inner life, however, was not what it once had been.&nbsp;
She had suffered a mental and emotional displacement&mdash;a
shock, which had set a shade of astonishment on her face as a
permanent thing.</p>
<p>Her indignation with the Baron for collusion with Jim, at
first bitter, lessened with the lapse of a few weeks, and at
length vanished in the interest of some tidings she received one
day.</p>
<p>The Baron was not dead, but he was no longer at the
Lodge.&nbsp; To the surprise of the physicians, a sufficient
improvement had taken place in his condition to permit of his
removal before the cold weather came.&nbsp; His desire for
removal had been such, indeed, that it was advisable to carry it
out at almost any risk.&nbsp; The plan adopted had been to have
him borne on men&rsquo;s shoulders in a sort of palanquin to the
shore near Idmouth, a distance of several miles, where a yacht
lay awaiting him.&nbsp; By this means the noise and jolting of a
carriage, along irregular bye-roads, were avoided.&nbsp; The
singular procession over the fields took place at night, and was
witnessed by but few people, one being a labouring man, who
described the scene to Margery.&nbsp; When the seaside was
reached a long, narrow gangway was laid from the deck of the
yacht to the shore, which was so steep as to allow the yacht to
lie quite near.&nbsp; The men, with their burden, ascended by the
light of lanterns, the sick man was laid in the cabin, and, as
soon as his bearers had returned to the shore, the gangway was
removed, a rope was heard skirring over wood in the darkness, the
yacht quivered, spread her woven wings to the air, and moved
away.&nbsp; Soon she was but a small, shapeless phantom upon the
wide breast of the sea.</p>
<p>It was said that the yacht was bound for Algiers.</p>
<p>When the inimical autumn and winter weather came on, Margery
wondered if he were still alive.&nbsp; The house being shut up,
and the servants gone, she had no means of knowing, till, on a
particular Saturday, her father drove her to Exonbury
market.&nbsp; Here, in attending to his business, he left her to
herself for awhile.&nbsp; Walking in a quiet street in the
professional quarter of the town, she saw coming towards her the
solicitor who had been present at the wedding, and who had acted
for the Baron in various small local matters during his brief
residence at the Lodge.</p>
<p>She reddened to peony hues, averted her eyes, and would have
passed him.&nbsp; But he crossed over and barred the pavement,
and when she met his glance he was looking with friendly severity
at her.&nbsp; The street was quiet, and he said in a low voice,
&lsquo;How&rsquo;s the husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;and are your stipulations about secrecy and
separate living still in force?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They will always be,&rsquo; she replied
decisively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Hayward and I agreed on the point,
and we have not the slightest wish to change the
arrangement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;tis Miss Tucker to the
world; Mrs. Hayward to me and one or two others only?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery nodded.&nbsp; Then she nerved herself by an effort,
and, though blushing painfully, asked, &lsquo;May I put one
question, sir?&nbsp; Is the Baron dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is dead to you and to all of us.&nbsp; Why should
you ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, if he&rsquo;s alive, I am sorry I married
James Hayward.&nbsp; If he is dead I do not much mind my
marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I repeat, he is dead to you,&rsquo; said the lawyer
emphatically.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know.&nbsp;
My professional services for him ended with his departure from
this country; but I think I should have heard from him if he had
been alive still.&nbsp; I have not heard at all: and this, taken
in connection with the nature of his illness, leaves no doubt in
my mind that he is dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery sighed, and thanking the lawyer she left him with a
tear for the Baron in her eye.&nbsp; After this incident she
became more restful; and the time drew on for her periodical
visit to her grandmother.</p>
<p>A few days subsequent to her arrival her aged relative asked
her to go with a message to the gardener at Mount Lodge (who
still lived on there, keeping the grounds in order for the
landlord).&nbsp; Margery hated that direction now, but she
went.&nbsp; The Lodge, which she saw over the trees, was to her
like a skull from which the warm and living flesh had
vanished.&nbsp; It was twilight by the time she reached the
cottage at the bottom of the Lodge garden, and, the room being
illuminated within, she saw through the window a woman she had
never seen before.&nbsp; She was dark, and rather handsome, and
when Margery knocked she opened the door.&nbsp; It was the
gardener&rsquo;s widowed daughter, who had been advised to make
friends with Margery.</p>
<p>She now found her opportunity.&nbsp; Margery&rsquo;s errand
was soon completed, the young widow, to her surprise, treating
her with preternatural respect, and afterwards offering to
accompany her home.&nbsp; Margery was not sorry to have a
companion in the gloom, and they walked on together.&nbsp; The
widow, Mrs. Peach, was demonstrative and confidential; and told
Margery all about herself.&nbsp; She had come quite recently to
live with her father&mdash;during the Baron&rsquo;s illness, in
fact&mdash;and her husband had been captain of a ketch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw you one morning, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you didn&rsquo;t see me.&nbsp; It was when
you were crossing the hill in sight of the Lodge.&nbsp; You
looked at it, and sighed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the lot of widows to
sigh, ma&rsquo;am, is it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Widows&mdash;yes, I suppose; but what do you
mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Peach lowered her voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say
more, ma&rsquo;am, with proper respect.&nbsp; But there seems to
be no question of the poor Baron&rsquo;s death; and though these
foreign princes can take (as my poor husband used to tell me)
what they call left-handed wives, and leave them behind when they
go abroad, widowhood is widowhood, left-handed or right.&nbsp;
And really, to be the left-handed wife of a foreign baron is
nobler than to be married all round to a common man.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll excuse my freedom, ma&rsquo;am; but being a widow
myself, I have pitied you from my heart; so young as you are, and
having to keep it a secret, and (excusing me) having no money out
of his vast riches because &rsquo;tis swallowed up by Baroness
Number One.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now Margery did not understand a word more of this than the
bare fact that Mrs. Peach suspected her to be the Baron&rsquo;s
undowered widow, and such was the milkmaid&rsquo;s nature that
she did not deny the widow&rsquo;s impeachment.&nbsp; The latter
continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But ah, ma&rsquo;am, all your troubles are straight
backward in your memory&mdash;while I have troubles before as
well as grief behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What may they be, Mrs. Peach?&rsquo; inquired Margery
with an air of the Baroness.</p>
<p>The other dropped her voice to revelation tones: &lsquo;I have
been forgetful enough of my first man to lose my heart to a
second!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t do that&mdash;it is wrong.&nbsp;
You should control your feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how am I to control my feelings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By going to your dead husband&rsquo;s grave, and things
of that sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you go to your dead husband&rsquo;s
grave?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I go to Algiers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;too true!&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve tried
everything to cure myself&mdash;read the words against it, gone
to the Table the first Sunday of every month, and all
sorts.&nbsp; But, avast, my shipmate!&mdash;as my poor man used
to say&mdash;there &rsquo;tis just the same.&nbsp; In short,
I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to encourage the new one.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis flattering that I, a new-comer, should have been found
out by a young man so soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is he?&rsquo; said Margery listlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A master lime-burner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A master lime-burner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s his profession.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
partner-in-co., doing very well indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to tell you his name, for, though
&rsquo;tis night, that covers all shame-facedness, my face is as
hot as a &rsquo;Talian iron, I declare!&nbsp; Do you just feel
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery put her hand on Mrs. Peach&rsquo;s face, and, sure
enough, hot it was.&nbsp; &lsquo;Does he come courting?&rsquo;
she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well only in the way of business.&nbsp; He never comes
unless lime is wanted in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s in
the Yeomanry, too, and will look very fine when he comes out in
regimentals for drill in May.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;in the Yeomanry,&rsquo; Margery said, with a
slight relief.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then it can&rsquo;t&mdash;is he a
young man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, junior partner-in-co.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The description had an odd resemblance to Jim, of whom Margery
had not heard a word for months.&nbsp; He had promised silence
and absence, and had fulfilled his promise literally, with a
gratuitous addition that was rather amazing, if indeed it were
Jim whom the widow loved.&nbsp; One point in the description
puzzled Margery: Jim was not in the Yeomanry, unless, by a
surprising development of enterprise, he had entered it
recently.</p>
<p>At parting Margery said, with an interest quite tender,
&lsquo;I should like to see you again, Mrs. Peach, and hear of
your attachment.&nbsp; When can you call?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;any time, dear Baroness, I&rsquo;m
sure&mdash;if you think I am good enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I do, Mrs. Peach.&nbsp; Come as soon as
you&rsquo;ve seen the lime-burner again.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p>Seeing that Jim lived several miles from the widow, Margery
was rather surprised, and even felt a slight sinking of the
heart, when her new acquaintance appeared at her door so soon as
the evening of the following Monday.&nbsp; She asked Margery to
walk out with her, which the young woman readily did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am come at once,&rsquo; said the widow breathlessly,
as soon as they were in the lane, &lsquo;for it is so exciting
that I can&rsquo;t keep it.&nbsp; I must tell it to somebody, if
only a bird, or a cat, or a garden snail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked her companion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve pulled grass from my husband&rsquo;s grave
to cure it&mdash;wove the blades into true lover&rsquo;s knots;
took off my shoes upon the sod; but, avast, my
shipmate,&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon the sod&mdash;why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To feel the damp earth he&rsquo;s in, and make the
sense of it enter my soul.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; It has swelled to
a head; he is going to meet me at the Yeomanry Review.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The master lime-burner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The widow nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When is it to be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow.&nbsp; He looks so lovely in his
accoutrements!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s such a splendid soldier; that was
the last straw that kindled my soul to say yes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
home from Exonbury for a night between the drills,&rsquo;
continued Mrs. Peach.&nbsp; &lsquo;He goes back to-morrow morning
for the Review, and when it&rsquo;s over he&rsquo;s going to meet
me.&nbsp; But, guide my heart, there he is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her exclamation had rise in the sudden appearance of a
brilliant red uniform through the trees, and the tramp of a horse
carrying the wearer thereof.&nbsp; In another half-minute the
military gentleman would have turned the corner, and faced
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;d better not see me; he&rsquo;ll think I know
too much,&rsquo; said Margery precipitately.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go up here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The widow, whose thoughts had been of the same cast, seemed
much relieved to see Margery disappear in the plantation, in the
midst of a spring chorus of birds.&nbsp; Once among the trees,
Margery turned her head, and, before she could see the
rider&rsquo;s person she recognized the horse as Tony, the
lightest of three that Jim and his partner owned, for the purpose
of carting out lime to their customers.</p>
<p>Jim, then, had joined the Yeomanry since his estrangement from
Margery.&nbsp; A man who had worn the young Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s uniform for seven days only could not be
expected to look as if it were part of his person, in the manner
of long-trained soldiers; but he was a well-formed young fellow,
and of an age when few positions came amiss to one who has the
capacity to adapt himself to circumstances.</p>
<p>Meeting the blushing Mrs. Peach (to whom Margery in her mind
sternly denied the right to blush at all), Jim alighted and moved
on with her, probably at Mrs. Peach&rsquo;s own suggestion; so
that what they said, how long they remained together, and how
they parted, Margery knew not.&nbsp; She might have known some of
these things by waiting; but the presence of Jim had bred in her
heart a sudden disgust for the widow, and a general sense of
discomfiture.&nbsp; She went away in an opposite direction,
turning her head and saying to the unconscious Jim,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a fine rod in pickle for you, my gentleman,
if you carry out that pretty scheme!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s military <i>coup</i> had decidedly astonished
her.&nbsp;&nbsp; What he might do next she could not
conjecture.&nbsp; The idea of his doing anything sufficiently
brilliant to arrest her attention would have seemed ludicrous,
had not Jim, by entering the Yeomanry, revealed a capacity for
dazzling exploits which made it unsafe to predict any limitation
to his powers.</p>
<p>Margery was now excited.&nbsp; The daring of the wretched Jim
in bursting into scarlet amazed her as much as his doubtful
acquaintanceship with the demonstrative Mrs. Peach.&nbsp; To go
to that Review, to watch the pair, to eclipse Mrs. Peach in
brilliancy, to meet and pass them in withering contempt&mdash;if
she only could do it!&nbsp; But, alas! she was a forsaken
woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the Baron were alive, or in England,&rsquo; she said
to herself (for sometimes she thought he might possibly be
alive), &lsquo;and he were to take me to this Review,
wouldn&rsquo;t I show that forward Mrs. Peach what a lady is
like, and keep among the select company, and not mix with the
common people at all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It might at first sight be thought that the best course for
Margery at this juncture would have been to go to Jim, and nip
the intrigue in the bud without further scruple.&nbsp; But her
own declaration in after days was that whoever could say that was
far from realizing her situation.&nbsp; It was hard to break such
ice as divided their two lives now, and to attempt it at that
moment was a too humiliating proclamation of defeat.&nbsp; The
only plan she could think of&mdash;perhaps not a wise one in the
circumstances&mdash;was to go to the Review herself; and be the
gayest there.</p>
<p>A method of doing this with some propriety soon occurred to
her.&nbsp; She dared not ask her father, who scorned to waste
time in sight-seeing, and whose animosity towards Jim knew no
abatement; but she might call on her old acquaintance, Mr. Vine,
Jim&rsquo;s partner, who would probably be going with the rest of
the holiday-folk, and ask if she might accompany him in his
spring-trap.&nbsp; She had no sooner perceived the feasibility of
this, through her being at her grandmother&rsquo;s, than she
decided to meet with the old man early the next morning.</p>
<p>In the meantime Jim and Mrs. Peach had walked slowly along the
road together, Jim leading the horse, and Mrs. Peach informing
him that her father, the gardener, was at Jim&rsquo;s village
further on, and that she had come to meet him.&nbsp; Jim, for
reasons of his own, was going to sleep at his partner&rsquo;s
that night, and thus their route was the same.&nbsp; The shades
of eve closed in upon them as they walked, and by the time they
reached the lime-kiln, which it was necessary to pass to get to
the village, it was quite dark.&nbsp; Jim stopped at the kiln, to
see if matters had progressed rightly in his seven days&rsquo;
absence, and Mrs. Peach, who stuck to him like a teazle, stopped
also, saying she would wait for her father there.</p>
<p>She held the horse while he ascended to the top of the
kiln.&nbsp; Then rejoining her, and not quite knowing what to do,
he stood beside her looking at the flames, which to-night burnt
up brightly, shining a long way into the dark air, even up to the
ramparts of the earthwork above them, and overhead into the
bosoms of the clouds.</p>
<p>It was during this proceeding that a carriage, drawn by a pair
of dark horses, came along the turnpike road.&nbsp; The light of
the kiln caused the horses to swerve a little, and the occupant
of the carriage looked out.&nbsp; He saw the bluish,
lightning-like flames from the limestone, rising from the top of
the furnace, and hard by the figures of Jim Hayward, the widow,
and the horse, standing out with spectral distinctness against
the mass of night behind.&nbsp; The scene wore the aspect of some
unholy assignation in Pandaemonium, and it was all the more
impressive from the fact that both Jim and the woman were quite
unconscious of the striking spectacle they presented.&nbsp; The
gentleman in the carriage watched them till he was borne out of
sight.</p>
<p>Having seen to the kiln, Jim and the widow walked on again,
and soon Mrs. Peach&rsquo;s father met them, and relieved Jim of
the lady.&nbsp; When they had parted, Jim, with an expiration not
unlike a breath of relief; went on to Mr. Vine&rsquo;s, and,
having put the horse into the stable, entered the house.&nbsp;
His partner was seated at the table, solacing himself after the
labours of the day by luxurious alternations between a long clay
pipe and a mug of perry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jim eagerly, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the
news&mdash;how do she take it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down&mdash;sit down,&rsquo; said Vine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis working well; not but that I deserve something
o&rsquo; thee for the trouble I&rsquo;ve had in watching
her.&nbsp; The soldiering was a fine move; but the woman is a
better!&mdash;who invented it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I myself,&rsquo; said Jim modestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; jealousy is making her rise like a thunderstorm,
and in a day or two you&rsquo;ll have her for the asking, my
sonny.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the next step?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The widow is getting rather a weight upon a feller,
worse luck,&rsquo; said Jim.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I must keep it up
until to-morrow, at any rate.&nbsp; I have promised to see her at
the Review, and now the great thing is that Margery should see we
a-smiling together&mdash;I in my full-dress uniform and clinking
arms o&rsquo; war.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be a good strong sting, and
will end the business, I hope.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you manage to
put the hoss in and drive her there?&nbsp; She&rsquo;d go if you
were to ask her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all my heart,&rsquo; said Mr. Vine, moistening the
end of a new pipe in his perry.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can call at her
grammer&rsquo;s for her&mdash;&rsquo;twill be all in my
way.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p>Margery duly followed up her intention by arraying herself the
next morning in her loveliest guise, and keeping watch for Mr.
Vine&rsquo;s appearance upon the high road, feeling certain that
his would form one in the procession of carts and carriages which
set in towards Exonbury that day.&nbsp; Jim had gone by at a very
early hour, and she did not see him pass.&nbsp; Her anticipation
was verified by the advent of Mr. Vine about eleven
o&rsquo;clock, dressed to his highest effort; but Margery was
surprised to find that, instead of her having to stop him, he
pulled in towards the gate of his own accord.&nbsp; The
invitation planned between Jim and the old man on the previous
night was now promptly given, and, as may be supposed, as
promptly accepted.&nbsp; Such a strange coincidence she had never
before known.&nbsp; She was quite ready, and they drove onward at
once.</p>
<p>The Review was held on some high ground a little way out of
the city, and her conductor suggested that they should put up the
horse at the inn, and walk to the field&mdash;a plan which
pleased her well, for it was more easy to take preliminary
observations on foot without being seen herself than when sitting
elevated in a vehicle.</p>
<p>They were just in time to secure a good place near the front,
and in a few minutes after their arrival the reviewing officer
came on the ground.&nbsp; Margery&rsquo;s eye had rapidly run
over the troop in which Jim was enrolled, and she discerned him
in one of the ranks, looking remarkably new and bright, both as
to uniform and countenance.&nbsp; Indeed, if she had not worked
herself into such a desperate state of mind she would have felt
proud of him then and there.&nbsp; His shapely upright figure was
quite noteworthy in the row of rotund yeomen on his right and
left; while his charger Tony expressed by his bearing, even more
than Jim, that he knew nothing about lime-carts whatever, and
everything about trumpets and glory.&nbsp; How Jim could have
scrubbed Tony to such shining blackness she could not tell, for
the horse in his natural state was ingrained with lime-dust, that
burnt the colour out of his coat as it did out of Jim&rsquo;s
hair.&nbsp; Now he pranced martially, and was a war-horse every
inch of him.</p>
<p>Having discovered Jim her next search was for Mrs. Peach, and,
by dint of some oblique glancing Margery indignantly discovered
the widow in the most forward place of all, her head and bright
face conspicuously advanced; and, what was more shocking, she had
abandoned her mourning for a violet drawn-bonnet and a gay
spencer, together with a parasol luxuriously fringed in a way
Margery had never before seen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where did she get the
money?&rsquo; said Margery, under her breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;And to
forget that poor sailor so soon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>These general reflections were precipitately postponed by her
discovering that Jim and the widow were perfectly alive to each
other&rsquo;s whereabouts, and in the interchange of telegraphic
signs of affection, which on the latter&rsquo;s part took the
form of a playful fluttering of her handkerchief or waving of her
parasol.&nbsp; Richard Vine had placed Margery in front of him,
to protect her from the crowd, as he said, he himself surveying
the scene over her bonnet.&nbsp; Margery would have been even
more surprised than she was if she had known that Jim was not
only aware of Mrs. Peach&rsquo;s presence, but also of her own,
the treacherous Mr. Vine having drawn out his flame-coloured
handkerchief and waved it to Jim over the young woman&rsquo;s
head as soon as they had taken up their position.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My partner makes a tidy soldier, eh&mdash;Miss
Tucker?&rsquo; said the senior lime-burner.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is my
belief as a Christian that he&rsquo;s got a party here that
he&rsquo;s making signs to&mdash;that handsome figure o&rsquo;
fun straight over-right him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps so,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it&rsquo;s growing warm between &rsquo;em if I
don&rsquo;t mistake,&rsquo; continued the merciless Vine.</p>
<p>Margery was silent, biting her lip; and the troops being now
set in motion, all signalling ceased for the present between
soldier Hayward and his pretended sweetheart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you a piece of paper that I could make a
memorandum on, Mr. Vine?&rsquo; asked Margery.</p>
<p>Vine took out his pocket-book and tore a leaf from it, which
he handed her with a pencil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t move from here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll return in a
minute,&rsquo; she continued, with the innocence of a woman who
means mischief.&nbsp; And, withdrawing herself to the back, where
the grass was clear, she pencilled down the words</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Jim&rsquo;s Married</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Armed with this document she crept into the throng behind the
unsuspecting Mrs. Peach, slipped the paper into her pocket on the
top of her handkerchief; and withdrew unobserved, rejoining Mr.
Vine with a bearing of <i>nonchalance</i>.</p>
<p>By-and-by the troops were in different order, Jim taking a
left-hand position almost close to Mrs. Peach.&nbsp; He bent down
and said a few words to her.&nbsp; From her manner of nodding
assent it was surely some arrangement about a meeting by-and-by
when Jim&rsquo;s drill was over, and Margery was more certain of
the fact when, the Review having ended, and the people having
strolled off to another part of the field where sports were to
take place, Mrs. Peach tripped away in the direction of the
city.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just say a word to my partner afore he goes
off the ground, if you&rsquo;ll spare me a minute,&rsquo; said
the old lime-burner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please stay here till I&rsquo;m
back again.&rsquo;&nbsp; He edged along the front till he reached
Jim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is she?&rsquo; said the latter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a trimming sweat,&rsquo; said Mr. Vine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And my counsel to &rsquo;ee is to carry this larry no
further.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill do no good.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s as
ready to make friends with &rsquo;ee as any wife can be; and more
showing off can only do harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I must finish off with a spurt,&rsquo; said
Jim.&nbsp; &lsquo;And this is how I am going to do it.&nbsp; I
have arranged with Mrs. Peach that, as soon as we soldiers have
entered the town and been dismissed, I&rsquo;ll meet her
there.&nbsp; It is really to say good-bye, but she don&rsquo;t
know that; and I wanted it to look like a lopement to
Margery&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;m clear of Mrs. Peach
I&rsquo;ll come back here and make it up with Margery on the
spot.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m coming, or she may be
inclined to throw off again.&nbsp; Just hint to her that I may be
meaning to be off to London with the widow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man still insisted that this was going too far.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, it isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Jim.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
know how to manage her.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill just mellow her heart
nicely by the time I come back.&nbsp; I must bring her down real
tender, or &rsquo;twill all fail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His senior reluctantly gave in and returned to Margery.&nbsp;
A short time afterwards the Yeomanry hand struck up, and Jim with
the regiment followed towards Exonbury.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; they are going to meet,&rsquo; said Margery
to herself, perceiving that Mrs. Peach had so timed her departure
as to be in the town at Jim&rsquo;s dismounting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now we will go and see the games,&rsquo; said Mr. Vine;
&lsquo;they are really worth seeing.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s greasy
poles, and jumping in sacks, and other trials of the intellect,
that nobody ought to miss who wants to be abreast of his
generation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Margery felt so indignant at the apparent assignation, which
seemed about to take place despite her anonymous writing, that
she helplessly assented to go anywhere, dropping behind Vine,
that he might not see her mood.</p>
<p>Jim followed out his programme with literal exactness.&nbsp;
No sooner was the troop dismissed in the city than he sent Tony
to stable and joined Mrs. Peach, who stood on the edge of the
pavement expecting him.&nbsp; But this acquaintance was to end:
he meant to part from her for ever and in the quickest time,
though civilly; for it was important to be with Margery as soon
as possible.&nbsp; He had nearly completed the man&oelig;uvre to
his satisfaction when, in drawing her handkerchief from her
pocket to wipe the tears from her eyes, Mrs. Peach&rsquo;s hand
grasped the paper, which she read at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! is that true?&rsquo; she said, holding it out to
Jim.</p>
<p>Jim started and admitted that it was, beginning an elaborate
explanation and apologies.&nbsp; But Mrs. Peach was thoroughly
roused, and then overcome.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s married,
he&rsquo;s married!&rsquo; she said, and swooned, or feigned to
swoon, so that Jim was obliged to support her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s married, he&rsquo;s married!&rsquo; said a
boy hard by who watched the scene with interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s married, he&rsquo;s married!&rsquo; said a
hilarious group of other boys near, with smiles several inches
broad, and shining teeth; and so the exclamation echoed down the
street.</p>
<p>Jim cursed his ill-luck; the loss of time that this dilemma
entailed grew serious; for Mrs. Peach was now in such a
hysterical state that he could not leave her with any good grace
or feeling.&nbsp; It was necessary to take her to a refreshment
room, lavish restoratives upon her, and altogether to waste
nearly half an hour.&nbsp; When she had kept him as long as she
chose, she forgave him; and thus at last he got away, his heart
swelling with tenderness towards Margery.&nbsp; He at once
hurried up the street to effect the reconciliation with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How shall I do it?&rsquo; he said to himself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll step round to her side, fish for her hand,
draw it through my arm as if I wasn&rsquo;t aware of it.&nbsp;
Then she&rsquo;ll look in my face, I shall look in hers, and we
shall march off the field triumphant, and the thing will be done
without takings or tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He entered the field and went straight as an arrow to the
place appointed for the meeting.&nbsp; It was at the back of a
refreshment tent outside the mass of spectators, and divided from
their view by the tent itself.&nbsp; He turned the corner of the
canvas, and there beheld Vine at the indicated spot.&nbsp; But
Margery was not with him.</p>
<p>Vine&rsquo;s hat was thrust back into his poll.&nbsp; His face
was pale, and his manner bewildered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hullo?
what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said Jim.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s my Margery?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve carried this footy game too far, my
man!&rsquo; exclaimed Vine, with the air of a friend who has
&lsquo;always told you so.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You ought to have
dropped it several days ago, when she would have come to
&rsquo;ee like a cooing dove.&nbsp; Now this is the end
o&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey! what, my Margery?&nbsp; Has anything happened, for
God&rsquo;s sake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s more than earthly man can tell!&nbsp; I
never see such a thing!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a stroke o&rsquo; the
black art&mdash;as if she were sperrited away.&nbsp; When we got
to the games I said&mdash;mind, you told me to!&mdash;I said,
&ldquo;Jim Hayward thinks o&rsquo; going off to London with that
widow woman&rdquo;&mdash;mind you told me to!&nbsp; She showed no
wonderment, though a&rsquo; seemed very low.&nbsp; Then she said
to me, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like standing here in this slummocky
crowd.&nbsp; I shall feel more at home among the
gentlepeople.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she went to where the
carriages were drawn up, and near her there was a grand coach,
a-blazing with lions and unicorns, and hauled by two coal-black
horses.&nbsp; I hardly thought much of it then, and by degrees
lost sight of her behind it.&nbsp; Presently the other carriages
moved off, and I thought still to see her standing there.&nbsp;
But no, she had vanished; and then I saw the grand coach rolling
away, and glimpsed Margery in it, beside a fine dark gentleman
with black mustachios, and a very pale prince-like face.&nbsp; As
soon as the horses got into the hard road they rattled on like
hell-and-skimmer, and went out of sight in the dust,
and&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d come back a
little sooner you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; caught her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim had turned whiter than his pipeclay.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, this
is too bad&mdash;too bad!&rsquo; he cried in anguish, striking
his brow.&nbsp; &lsquo;That paper and that fainting woman kept me
so long.&nbsp; Who could have done it?&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis my
fault.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve stung her too much.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t have carried it so far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;just what I said,&rsquo;
replied his senior.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She thinks I&rsquo;ve gone off with that cust widow;
and to spite me she&rsquo;s gone off with the man!&nbsp; Do you
know who that stranger wi&rsquo; the lions and unicorns is?&nbsp;
Why, &rsquo;tis that foreigner who calls himself a Baron, and
took Mount Lodge for six months last year to make
mischief&mdash;a villain!&nbsp; O, my Margery&mdash;that it
should come to this!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s lost, she&rsquo;s
ruined!&mdash;Which way did they go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim turned to follow in the direction indicated, when, behold,
there stood at his back her father, Dairyman Tucker.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now look here, young man,&rsquo; said Dairyman
Tucker.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just heard all that
wailing&mdash;and straightway will ask &rsquo;ee to stop it
sharp.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis like your brazen impudence to teave and
wail when you be another woman&rsquo;s husband; yes, faith, I
see&rsquo;d her a-fainting in yer arms when you wanted to get
away from her, and honest folk a-standing round who knew
you&rsquo;d married her, and said so.&nbsp; I heard it, though
you didn&rsquo;t see me.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s married!&rdquo;
says they.&nbsp; Some sly register-office business, no doubt; but
sly doings will out.&nbsp; As for Margery&mdash;who&rsquo;s to be
called higher titles in these parts
hencefor&rsquo;ard&mdash;I&rsquo;m her father, and I say
it&rsquo;s all right what she&rsquo;s done.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I
know private news, hey?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t I just learnt that
secret weddings of high people can happen at expected deathbeds
by special licence, as well as low people at registrars&rsquo;
offices?&nbsp; And can&rsquo;t husbands come back and claim their
own when they choose?&nbsp; Begone, young man, and leave
noblemen&rsquo;s wives alone; and I thank God I shall be rid of a
numskull!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swift words of explanation rose to Jim&rsquo;s lips, but they
paused there and died.&nbsp; At that last moment he could not, as
Margery&rsquo;s husband, announce Margery&rsquo;s shame and his
own, and transform her father&rsquo;s triumph to wretchedness at
a blow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;must leave here,&rsquo; he
stammered.&nbsp; Going from the place in an opposite course to
that of the fugitives, he doubled when out of sight, and in an
incredibly short space had entered the town.&nbsp; Here he made
inquiries for the emblazoned carriage, and gained from one or two
persons a general idea of its route.&nbsp; They thought it had
taken the highway to London.&nbsp; Saddling poor Tony before he
had half eaten his corn, Jim galloped along the same road.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p>Now Jim was quite mistaken in supposing that by leaving the
field in a roundabout manner he had deceived Dairyman Tucker as
to his object.&nbsp; That astute old man immediately divined that
Jim was meaning to track the fugitives, in ignorance (as the
dairyman supposed) of their lawful relation.&nbsp; He was soon
assured of the fact, for, creeping to a remote angle of the
field, he saw Jim hastening into the town.&nbsp; Vowing vengeance
on the young lime-burner for his mischievous interference between
a nobleman and his secretly-wedded wife, the dairy-farmer
determined to balk him.</p>
<p>Tucker had ridden on to the Review ground, so that there was
no necessity for him, as there had been for poor Jim, to re-enter
the town before starting.&nbsp; The dairyman hastily untied his
mare from the row of other horses, mounted, and descended to a
bridle-path which would take him obliquely into the London road a
mile or so ahead.&nbsp; The old man&rsquo;s route being along one
side of an equilateral triangle, while Jim&rsquo;s was along two
sides of the same, the former was at the point of intersection
long before Hayward.</p>
<p>Arrived here, the dairyman pulled up and looked around.&nbsp;
It was a spot at which the highway forked; the left arm, the more
important, led on through Sherton Abbas and Melchester to London;
the right to Idmouth and the coast.&nbsp; Nothing was visible on
the white track to London; but on the other there appeared the
back of a carriage, which rapidly ascended a distant hill and
vanished under the trees.&nbsp; It was the Baron&rsquo;s who,
according to the sworn information of the gardener at Mount
Lodge, had made Margery his wife.</p>
<p>The carriage having vanished, the dairyman gazed in the
opposite direction, towards Exonbury.&nbsp; Here he beheld Jim in
his regimentals, laboriously approaching on Tony&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>Soon he reached the forking roads, and saw the dairyman by the
wayside.&nbsp; But Jim did not halt.&nbsp; Then the dairyman
practised the greatest duplicity of his life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right along the London road, if you want to catch
&rsquo;em!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank &rsquo;ee, dairyman, thank &rsquo;ee!&rsquo;
cried Jim, his pale face lighting up with gratitude, for he
believed that Tucker had learnt his mistake from Vine, and had
come to his assistance.&nbsp; Without drawing rein he diminished
along the road not taken by the flying pair.&nbsp; The dairyman
rubbed his hands with delight, and returned to the city as the
cathedral clock struck five.</p>
<p>Jim pursued his way through the dust, up hill and down hill;
but never saw ahead of him the vehicle of his search.&nbsp; That
vehicle was passing along a diverging way at a distance of many
miles from where he rode.&nbsp; Still he sped onwards, till Tony
showed signs of breaking down; and then Jim gathered from
inquiries he made that he had come the wrong way.&nbsp; It burst
upon his mind that the dairyman, still ignorant of the truth, had
misinformed him.&nbsp; Heavier in his heart than words can
describe he turned Tony&rsquo;s drooping head, and resolved to
drag his way home.</p>
<p>But the horse was now so jaded that it was impossible to
proceed far.&nbsp; Having gone about half a mile back he came
again to a small roadside hamlet and inn, where he put up Tony
for a rest and feed.&nbsp; As for himself, there was no quiet in
him.&nbsp; He tried to sit and eat in the inn kitchen; but he
could not stay there.&nbsp; He went out, and paced up and down
the road.</p>
<p>Standing in sight of the white way by which he had come he
beheld advancing towards him the horses and carriage he sought,
now black and daemonic against the slanting fires of the western
sun.</p>
<p>The why and wherefore of this sudden appearance he did not
pause to consider.&nbsp; His resolve to intercept the carriage
was instantaneous.&nbsp; He ran forward, and doggedly waiting
barred the way to the advancing equipage.</p>
<p>The Baron&rsquo;s coachman shouted, but Jim stood firm as a
rock, and on the former attempting to push past him Jim drew his
sword, resolving to cut the horses down rather than be
displaced.&nbsp; The animals were thrown nearly back upon their
haunches, and at this juncture a gentleman looked out of the
window.&nbsp; It was the Baron himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;James Hayward!&rsquo; replied the young man fiercely,
&lsquo;and he demands his wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Baron leapt out, and told the coachman to drive back out
of sight and wait for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was hastening to find you,&rsquo; he said to
Jim.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your wife is where she ought to be, and where
you ought to be also&mdash;by your own fireside.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the other woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim, without replying, looked incredulously into the carriage
as it turned.&nbsp; Margery was certainly not there.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The other woman is nothing to me,&rsquo; he said
bitterly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I used her to warm up Margery: I have now
done with her.&nbsp; The question I ask, my lord, is, what
business had you with Margery to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My business was to help her to regain the husband she
had seemingly lost.&nbsp; I saw her; she told me you had eloped
by the London road with another.&nbsp; I, who
have&mdash;mostly&mdash;had her happiness at heart, told her I
would help her to follow you if she wished.&nbsp; She gladly
agreed; we drove after, but could hear no tidings of you in front
of us.&nbsp; Then I took her&mdash;to your house&mdash;and there
she awaits you.&nbsp; I promised to send you to her if human
effort could do it, and was tracking you for that
purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been a-pursuing after me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You and the widow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve been pursuing after you and
Margery!&nbsp; My noble lord, your actions seem to show that I
ought to believe you in this; and when you say you&rsquo;ve her
happiness at heart, I don&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;ve
formerly proved it to be so.&nbsp; Well, Heaven forbid that I
should think wrongfully of you if you don&rsquo;t deserve
it!&nbsp; A mystery to me you have always been, my noble lord,
and in this business more than in any.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear you say no worse.&nbsp; In one hour
you&rsquo;ll have proof of my conduct&mdash;good and bad.&nbsp;
Can I do anything more?&nbsp; Say the word, and I&rsquo;ll
try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jim reflected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Baron,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am
a plain man, and wish only to lead a quiet life with my wife, as
a man should.&nbsp; You have great power over her&mdash;power to
any extent, for good or otherwise.&nbsp; If you command her
anything on earth, righteous or questionable, that she&rsquo;ll
do.&nbsp; So that, since you ask me if you can do more for me,
I&rsquo;ll answer this, you can promise never to see her
again.&nbsp; I mean no harm, my lord; but your presence can do no
good; you will trouble us.&nbsp; If I return to her, will you for
ever stay away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hayward,&rsquo; said the Baron, &lsquo;I swear to you
that I will disturb you and your wife by my presence no
more.&nbsp; And he took Jim&rsquo;s hand, and pressed it within
his own upon the hilt of Jim&rsquo;s sword.</p>
<p>In relating this incident to the present narrator Jim used to
declare that, to his fancy, the ruddy light of the setting sun
burned with more than earthly fire on the Baron&rsquo;s face as
the words were spoken; and that the ruby flash of his eye in the
same light was what he never witnessed before nor since in the
eye of mortal man.&nbsp; After this there was nothing more to do
or say in that place.&nbsp; Jim accompanied his
never-to-be-forgotten acquaintance to the carriage, closed the
door after him, waved his hat to him, and from that hour he and
the Baron met not again on earth.</p>
<p>A few words will suffice to explain the fortunes of Margery
while the foregoing events were in action elsewhere.&nbsp; On
leaving her companion Vine she had gone distractedly among the
carriages, the rather to escape his observation than of any set
purpose.&nbsp; Standing here she thought she heard her name
pronounced, and turning, saw her foreign friend, whom she had
supposed to be, if not dead, a thousand miles off.&nbsp; He
beckoned, and she went close.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are ill&mdash;you
are wretched,&rsquo; he said, looking keenly in her face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She told him her sad suspicion that Jim had run away from
her.&nbsp; The Baron reflected, and inquired a few other
particulars of her late life.&nbsp; Then he said: &lsquo;You and
I must find him.&nbsp; Come with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this word of
command from the Baron she had entered the carriage as docilely
as a child, and there she sat beside him till he chose to speak,
which was not till they were some way out of the town, at the
forking ways, and the Baron had discovered that Jim was certainly
not, as they had supposed, making off from Margery along that
particular branch of the fork that led to London.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To pursue him in this way is useless, I
perceive,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the proper course now
is that I should take you to his house.&nbsp; That done I will
return, and bring him to you if mortal persuasion can do
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go to his house without him,
sir,&rsquo; said she, tremblingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to!&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let me remind you, Margery Hayward, that your place is in
your husband&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Till you are there you have no
right to criticize his conduct, however wild it may be.&nbsp; Why
have you not been there before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; she murmured, her tears
falling silently upon her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to be there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you ought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still she did not speak.</p>
<p>The Baron sank into silence, and allowed his eye to rest on
her.&nbsp; What thoughts were all at once engaging his mind after
those moments of reproof?&nbsp; Margery had given herself into
his hands without a remonstrance, her husband had apparently
deserted her.&nbsp; She was absolutely in his power, and they
were on the high road.</p>
<p>That his first impulse in inviting her to accompany him had
been the legitimate one denoted by his words cannot reasonably be
doubted.&nbsp; That his second was otherwise soon became
revealed, though not at first to her, for she was too bewildered
to notice where they were going.&nbsp; Instead of turning and
taking the road to Jim&rsquo;s, the Baron, as if influenced
suddenly by her reluctance to return thither if Jim was playing
truant, signalled to the coachman to take the branch road to the
right, as her father had discerned.</p>
<p>They soon approached the coast near Idmouth.&nbsp; The
carriage stopped.&nbsp; Margery awoke from her reverie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are we?&rsquo; she said, looking out of the
window, with a start.&nbsp; Before her was an inlet of the sea,
and in the middle of the inlet rode a yacht, its masts repeating
as if from memory the rocking they had practised in their native
forest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At a little sea-side nook, where my yacht lies at
anchor,&rsquo; he said tentatively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Margery, in
five minutes we can be aboard, and in half an hour we can be
sailing away all the world over.&nbsp; Will you come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot decide,&rsquo; she said, in low tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then on a sudden, Margery seemed to see all contingencies: she
became white as a fleece, and a bewildered look came into her
eyes.&nbsp; With clasped hands she leant on the Baron.</p>
<p>Baron von Xanten observed her distracted look, averted his
face, and coming to a decision opened the carriage door, quickly
mounted outside, and in a second or two the carriage left the
shore behind, and ascended the road by which it had come.</p>
<p>In about an hour they reached Jim Hayward&rsquo;s home.&nbsp;
The Baron alighted, and spoke to her through the window.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Margery, can you forgive a lover&rsquo;s bad impulse,
which I swear was unpremeditated?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you can, shake my hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not do it, but eventually allowed him to help her out
of the carriage.&nbsp; He seemed to feel the awkwardness keenly;
and seeing it, she said, &lsquo;Of course I forgive you, sir, for
I felt for a moment as you did.&nbsp; Will you send my husband to
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, if any man can,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Such penance is milder than I deserve!&nbsp; God bless you
and give you happiness!&nbsp; I shall never see you
again!&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned, entered the carriage, and was
gone; and having found out Jim&rsquo;s course, came up with him
upon the road as described.</p>
<p>In due time the latter reached his lodging at his
partner&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The woman who took care of the house in
Vine&rsquo;s absence at once told Jim that a lady who had come in
a carriage was waiting for him in his sitting-room.&nbsp; Jim
proceeded thither with agitation, and beheld, shrinkingly
ensconced in the large slippery chair, and surrounded by the
brilliant articles that had so long awaited her, his
long-estranged wife.</p>
<p>Margery&rsquo;s eyes were round and fear-stricken.&nbsp; She
essayed to speak, but Jim, strangely enough, found the readier
tongue then.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did I do it, you would ask,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot tell.&nbsp; Do you forgive my
deception?&nbsp; O Margery&mdash;you are my Margery still!&nbsp;
But how could you trust yourself in the Baron&rsquo;s hands this
afternoon, without knowing him better?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He said I was to come, and I went,&rsquo; she said, as
well as she could for tearfulness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You obeyed him blindly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did.&nbsp; But perhaps I was not justified in doing
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Jim musingly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think he&rsquo;s a good man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Margery did
not explain.&nbsp; And then a sunnier mood succeeded her
tremblings and tears, till old Mr. Vine came into the house
below, and Jim went down to declare that all was well, and sent
off his partner to break the news to Margery&rsquo;s father, who
as yet remained unenlightened.</p>
<p>The dairyman bore the intelligence of his daughter&rsquo;s
untitled state as best he could, and punished her by not coming
near her for several weeks, though at last he grumbled his
forgiveness, and made up matters with Jim.&nbsp; The handsome
Mrs. Peach vanished to Plymouth, and found another sailor, not
without a reasonable complaint against Jim and Margery both that
she had been unfairly used.</p>
<p>As for the mysterious gentleman who had exercised such an
influence over their lives, he kept his word, and was a stranger
to Lower Wessex thenceforward.&nbsp; Baron or no Baron,
Englishman or foreigner, he had shown a genuine interest in Jim,
and real sorrow for a certain reckless phase of his acquaintance
with Margery.&nbsp; That he had a more tender feeling toward the
young girl than he wished her or any one else to perceive there
could be no doubt.&nbsp; That he was strongly tempted at times to
adopt other than conventional courses with regard to her is also
clear, particularly at that critical hour when she rolled along
the high road with him in the carriage, after turning from the
fancied pursuit of Jim.&nbsp; But at other times he schooled
impassioned sentiments into fair conduct, which even erred on the
side of harshness.&nbsp; In after years there was a report that
another attempt on his life with a pistol, during one of those
fits of moodiness to which he seemed constitutionally liable, had
been effectual; but nobody in Silverthorn was in a position to
ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>There he is still regarded as one who had something about him
magical and unearthly.&nbsp; In his mystery let him remain; for a
man, no less than a landscape, who awakens an interest under
uncertain lights and touches of unfathomable shade, may cut but a
poor figure in a garish noontide shine.</p>
<p>When she heard of his mournful death Margery sat in her
nursing-chair, gravely thinking for nearly ten minutes, to the
total neglect of her infant in the cradle.&nbsp; Jim, from the
other side of the fire-place, said: &lsquo;You are sorry enough
for him, Margery.&nbsp; I am sure of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;I am
sorry.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a moment she added: &lsquo;Now that
he&rsquo;s dead I&rsquo;ll make a confession, Jim, that I have
never made to a soul.&nbsp; If he had pressed me&mdash;which he
did not&mdash;to go with him when I was in the carriage that
night beside his yacht, I would have gone.&nbsp; And I was
disappointed that he did not press me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose he were to suddenly appear now, and say in a
voice of command, &ldquo;Margery, come with me!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe I should have no power to disobey,&rsquo; she
returned, with a mischievous look.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was like a
magician to me.&nbsp; I think he was one.&nbsp; He could move me
as a loadstone moves a speck of steel . . . Yet no,&rsquo; she
added, hearing the infant cry, &lsquo;he would not move me
now.&nbsp; It would be so unfair to baby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jim, with no great concern (for
&lsquo;<i>la jalousie r&eacute;trospective</i>,&rsquo; as George
Sand calls it, had nearly died out of him), &lsquo;however he
might move &rsquo;ee, my love, he&rsquo;ll never come.&nbsp; He
swore it to me: and he was a man of his word.&rsquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
